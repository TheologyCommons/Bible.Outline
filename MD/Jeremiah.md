and destructive.

### Judah\'s true God (10:6-7, 17-25):

JEREMIAH\'S SYMBOL (27:1-28:17) 
-------------------------------

### His object lesson (27:1-22) 

#### What it is (27:1-2): 

Jeremiah is to make a yoke and to fasten it on his neck with leather
thongs.

#### What it means (27:3-22) 

##### To certain nations it symbolizes destruction (27:3-11): 

Five pagan countries (Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon) will fall
victim to Nebuchadnezzar and his Babylonian armies.

##### To the chosen nation (Judah), it symbolizes either life or destruction (27:12-22): 

Jeremiah says, \"Surrender to the king of Babylon, and you will live.\"

### His opposition (28:1-17): 

A prophet from Gibeon now confronts Jeremiah.

#### Hananiah\'s deceit (28:1-9) 

##### Hananiah (28:1-4): 

God has told me there will be peace in two years! Therefore, Jeremiah is
wrong!

##### Jeremiah (28:5-9): 

\"A prophet who predicts peace must carry the burden of proof. Only when
his predictions come true can it be known that he is really from the
LORD.\"

#### Hananiah\'s defiance (28:10-11): 

He takes the yoke off Jeremiah\'s neck and breaks it.

#### Hananiah\'s doom (28:12-17): 

God tells Jeremiah to say to Hananiah that he will die for his sins that
very year. Two months later Hananiah dies.

===========

In this chapter Jeremiah records the contents of three letters.

FIRST LETTER (29:1-23) 
----------------------

### The person and place (29:1a): 

Jeremiah writes this letter from Jerusalem.

### The parties and purpose (29:1b-23): 

He writes to the Jewish exiles living in Babylon, for a twofold purpose:

#### To comfort and instruct (29:1b-14) 

##### Build, plant, marry, and raise children, for you\'ll be in Babylon for 70 years (29:1b-7, 10). 

##### Realize that after 70 years, God will bring you back to the land and will greatly prosper you (29:11-14): 

His plans are for good and not for evil.

##### Don\'t believe the lying prophets in Babylon who tell you differently (29:8-9): 

They do not prophesy in God\'s name.

#### To condemn (29:15-23): 

Jeremiah warns the exiles that soon two groups of people will be
severely punished by God.

##### First group (29:15-19): 

The countrymen of the exiles (including King Zedekiah), still living
their sinful lives in Jerusalem

##### Second group (29:20-23): 

The lying and immoral prophets like Ahab and Zedekiah who conduct their
godless ministries in Babylon

Shemaiah tells Zephaniah, a priest living in Jerusalem, that God has
appointed him (Zephaniah) to:

#### Replace the current high priest, Jehoiada (29:25-26): 

He is also to put anyone claiming to be a prophet in the stocks and neck
irons.

#### Silence Jeremiah the prophet (29:27-29). 

THIRD LETTER (29:30-32) 
-----------------------

### The person and place (29:30): 

Jeremiah writes from Jerusalem.

### The parties and purpose (29:31-32):

the coming great tribulation.

THE COVENANT GUARANTEEING THIS RESTORATION (31:31-40)

It is unconditional, unlike the covenant God made with Moses, which was
dissolved because of Israel\'s continual sin.

### Its security (31:35-40): 

It lasts as long as the sun and stars give forth their light.

JEREMIAH 32-33

valuable ground, occupied by Jewish people.

The prophet acknowledges God\'s sovereignty over Israel in the past and
in the present.

JEREMIAH 34-36 
==============

Jeremiah warns wicked King Zedekiah again about God\'s coming judgment.
When the monarch does not listen, Jerusalem is captured, and Zedekiah is
taken into captivity. God then sends Jeremiah to search for godly role
models for Judah.

Following Jeremiah\'s orders, Baruch reads the scroll first to the
people and then to the administrative officials.

scroll.

Jehudi reads the scroll to Zedekiah as the king sits beside his
fireplace.

###### His dynasty will not continue (36:29-30a): 

None of Jehoiakim\'s heirs will sit on the throne.

###### \"His dead body will be thrown out to lie unburied\" (36:30b-31). 

JUDAH\'S ROLE MODELS (35:1-19): 
-------------------------------

God commands Jeremiah to visit a settlement in Judah where the Recabites
live.

### Jeremiah\'s offer (35:1-5): 

He tests the Recabites by offering them some wine.

### The Recabites\' objection (35:6-11): 

They correctly refuse, on the grounds that it would ruin their testimony
and would cause them to disobey the command of their ancestor Jehonadab,
son of Recab, who had forbidden such wine drinking (along with other
commands).

### God\'s object lesson (35:12-19): 

God commends this action and instructs Jeremiah to present the Recabites
as role models to Judah.

from this death pit.

The prophet once again summarizes God\'s message:

#### Surrender to the Babylonians, and Jerusalem will be spared (38:14-17, 20): 

The city will not be burned.

Jeremiah gives a special scroll to Seraiah, an exile and former officer
under Zedekiah, who was en route to Babylon.

#### The information (51:60): 

It describes God\'s judgment upon Babylon.

#### The instructions (51:61-64): 

Upon arriving in Babylon, Seraiah is to read the scroll, then tie a rock
to it and throw it into the Euphrates River, illustrating that Babylon
will soon sink, never to rise again.

They will coe back to Jerusalem and will tell what the Lord has done.

### The shepherd (50:33-34; 51:15-19)

#### \"He made the earth by his power, and he preserves it by his wisdom\" (51:15-16). 

#### He alone, unlike the idols, is the true God (51:17-19): 

All idols will be destroyed, but God is \"the Creator of everything that
exists.\"
