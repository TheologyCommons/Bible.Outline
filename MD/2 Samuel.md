Ammonite cities.

DAVID THE SINNER (11:1-27) 
--------------------------

### His sin of adultery (11:1-5): Two factors lead to this tragic sin: 

#### David\'s laziness (11:1): 

David stays behind in the royal palace and sends Joab to lead the
Israelites to fight the Ammonites.

#### David\'s lust (11:2-5): 

David watches a beautiful woman named Bathsheba as she bathes.

> for her and sleeps with her. Soon he learns she is pregnant with his
> child.

### His sin of deceit (11:6-13): David tries to cover up his sin of adultery. 

#### The unscrupulous plan (11:6-8): 

David recalls Uriah (Bathsheba\'s husband) from the battlefield,
encouraging him to spend time with Bathsheba. David hopes that Uriah
will sleep with his wife and think that David\'s child is his.

#### The unsuccessful plan (11:9-13): 

Twice Uriah refuses to go home to his wife.

### His sin of murder (11:14-27):

wives.

David sends a sealed letter to Joab by way of Uriah, ordering Joab to
arrange for loyal Uriah\'s death.

Joab places Uriah in the fiercest part of the battle, and he is killed
just as David planned.

#### The disapproval (11:22-27): 

News reaches David that Uriah has been killed, so he marries the widowed
Bathsheba after her period of mourning. Soon after this, a son is born.
But the Lord is highly displeased with what David has done.

DAVID THE SORROWFUL (12:1-13) 
-----------------------------

### The confrontation (12:1-12): 

The Lord sends Nathan the prophet to confront David regarding his sin.

#### The illustration (12:1-4): 

Nathan relates the story of how a rich farmer with many lambs takes the
sole lamb of a poor farmer.

worships God. He testifies that one day he will join the baby in death,
but the baby can never return to him.

### The blessed event: the birth of Bathsheba\'s foremost son (12:24-25): 

Later Bathsheba gives birth to Solomon, whose name means \"peace.\" The
Lord, however, tells David that his name should be Jedidiah, meaning
\"beloved of the LORD.\"

-----------------------------

David captures the Ammonite city of Rabbah, making slaves of the people
and taking great amounts of gold, including a special golden crown set
with precious stones.

him for a time.

THE RAPE (13:1-19) 
------------------

of Absalom.

#### The particulars (14:4-20) 

##### Setting the trap (14:4-11): 

This woman approaches David, pretending that one of her two sons killed
the other. She asks for mercy upon the survivor. David guarantees that
her son will be allowed to safely return.

##### Springing the trap (14:12-20): 

The woman then urges David to do this same thing for his son Absalom.

### The summons by David (14:21-33)

David\'s own son Absalom organizes a rebellion against him.

### The politics of the plot (15:1-6): 

Absalom captures the people\'s hearts by assuring them that his kingship
would bring about a far more just society than did his father\'s.

The rebellion begins in the city of Hebron. He also sends messengers to
other parts of Israel to stir up trouble.

THE PEOPLE ENJOINED (15:13-29): 
-------------------------------

David learns of the rebellion. As he flees Jerusalem to escape Absalom,
he gives commands to three men who flee with him.

### Ittai (15:17-22) 

#### The leader (15:17-20): 

Ittai is the captain of the 600 Gittite soldiers who have joined David.

David urges him to return to Jerusalem, since he and his men have only

#### Hushai and David (15:30-37): 

A faithful friend named Hushai is waiting for David on the Mount of
Olives. David instructs him to return to Jerusalem and offer himself as

offer Absalom wrong advice on how to conduct the rebellion.

#### Hushai and Absalom (16:15-19): 

Hushai and Ahithophel, David\'s former adviser who has turned against
him, eventually meet with Absalom. After Hushai explains that he has
turned against David, it appears that Absalom accepts him as his
adviser.

### Ziba (16:1-4):

master has turned against David as well. So David grants Ziba all that

and tells him that the Lord is repaying him for stealing Saul\'s throne.

understandable since he is Saul\'s relative.

THE PROFANITY EMBRACED (16:20-23):

roof and sleeps with David\'s concubines, publicly insulting David.

Absalom\'s men. Twenty thousand men die in the battle, including
Absalom. David mourns Absalom\'s death.

THE RUSE (17:1-14, 23): 
-----------------------

Ahithophel and Hushai offer conflicting advice to Absalom.

### The correct advice of Ahithophel (17:1-4): 

Ahithophel urges Absalom to attack David\'s troops immediately while
David is still weary and weak.

### The crafty advice of Hushai (17:5-14, 23): 

Hushai advises that the attack be delayed until a large number of
soldiers throughout the land can be assembled. Then Absalom himself
should lead them into battle. Hushai\'s plan is accepted, causing
Ahithophel to go home and hang himself.

THE RELAY (17:15-23):

thick branches of a large oak, and he is left dangling helplessly in the

Disregarding David\'s instructions, Joab plunges three daggers into
Absalom\'s heart.

a messenger brings him word that his enemies are defeated and Absalom is
dead.

THE REMORSE (18:33):

Bursting into tears, David wishes that he had died instead of his son.

Shimei, who previously cursed David, meets David at the Jordan River and
pleads for mercy.

##### David\'s forgiveness (19:21-23): 

The king grants him mercy and assures him that his life will be spared.

#### David and Mephibosheth (19:24-30): 

Mephibosheth also comes to meet David; David asks him why he stayed in
Jerusalem during the revolt. Mephibosheth claims that Ziba refused to
help him leave and lied about his loyalty. So David divides Saul\'s land
equally between Ziba and Mephibosheth.

David invites 80-year-old Barzillai to accompany him back to Jerusalem
and live in the palace, but he declines the offer.

The other tribes complain about the favor shown to Judah in this way.

------------------------------------

### Sheba\'s uprising (20:1-13) 

#### Sheba\'s conspiracy (20:1-2): 

Sheba, a Benjaminite, leads a rebellion against David, supported by all
Israel\'s tribes except Judah.

#### David\'s concern (20:3-7): 

David perceives Sheba\'s threat to be more dangerous than even
Absalom\'s rebellion, so he orders Amasa to mobilize the entire army of
Judah to fight against Sheba.

#### Joab\'s cruelty (20:8-13): 

Joab assassinates Amasa to regain his former position as David\'s

> military commander.

### Sheba\'s undoing (20:14-22)

Sheba seeks refuge in the city of Abel, so Joab attacks the city.

#### The wise woman of Abel (20:16-22):

good on her promise, and Joab calls off the attack on the city.

--------------------------------

David\'s leaders are listed, including his military commanders, the
leader of his labor force, his royal historian, his secretary, and his
priests.

THE TRANSGRESSION OF SAUL (21:1-14) 
-----------------------------------

### The problem (21:1-2): 

David asks God why Israel is being punished by a famine; he is told it
is because Saul tried to wipe out the Gibeonites.

### The plan (21:3-9) 

#### David\'s meeting (21:3-6): 

The king confers with the Gibeonites, who demand that seven of Saul\'s
descendants be handed over to them to be executed.

#### David\'s mercy (21:7-9): 

David grants their demand, but he does not allow Jonathan\'s son
