JOB\'S PRESTIGE (1:1-5) 
-----------------------

### His faith (1:1): 

\"There was a man named Job who lived in the land of Uz. He was
blameless, a man of complete integrity. He feared God and stayed away
from evil.\"

### His fortune (1:3): 

\"He owned 7,000 sheep, and 3,000 camels, 500 teams of oxen, and 500
female donkeys, and he employed many servants. He was, in fact, the
richest person in that entire area.\"

### His family (1:2, 4-5): \"He had seven sons and three daughters.\" 

JOB\'S PAIN (1:6-22; 2:1-10): 
-----------------------------

For reasons unknown to Job, he suffers two waves of tragedy.

### The record of his trials (1:13-19; 2:7-8) 

#### First wave (1:13-19): 

In one day Job experiences four terrible tragedies: The Sabeans steal
all his oxen and donkeys and kill his farmhands. Fire falls from heaven
and burns up his sheep and his shepherds. Chaldeans carry off all his
camels and kill his servants. Finally, a mighty wind blows down the
house where his sons and daughters are, killing all of them.

#### Second wave (2:7-8): 

Job is afflicted with painful boils from head to foot.

### The reason for his trials (1:6-12; 2:1-6): 

All of Job\'s trials result from two confrontations between God and
Satan.

#### The first confrontation (1:6-12): 

This first confrontation gives rise to the first wave of Job\'s
tragedies.

##### The assembling (1:6-7): 

\"One day the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, and
Satan the Accuser came with them.\"

##### The appraisal (1:8): 

\"Then the LORD asked Satan, \'Have you noticed my servant Job? He is
the finest man in all the earth-a man of complete integrity. He fears
God and will have nothing to do with evil.\"\'

##### The accusation (1:9-11): 

Satan scoffs that Job only serves God because God blesses him. Satan
says that if all Job\'s blessings were taken away, he would curse God.

##### The agreement (1:12): 

God gives Satan permission to do anything to all that Job has, but he is
not to touch him physically.

#### The second confrontation (2:1-6): 

This second confrontation gives rise to the second wave of Job\'s
tragedies.

##### The review (2:1-3): 

God reminds Satan that Job has remained faithful despite his trials.

##### The reproach (2:4-5): 

Satan responds, \"But take away his health, and he will surely curse you
to your face!\"

##### The restriction (2:6): 

God allows Satan to take Job\'s health but not his life.

### The reaction to his trials (1:20-22; 2:9-10) 

#### Following the first wave of tragedy (1:20-22): 

Job is deeply grieved, but he recognizes that he has come into the world
with nothing and will leave with nothing. Mindful of this, he chooses to
praise God and not blame him.

#### Following the second wave of tragedy (2:9-10): 

Despite the urgings of Job\'s wife to \"curse God and die,\" Job does
not sin by anything he says.

JOB\'S PITY (2:11-13): 
----------------------

Three of Job\'s friends come to comfort him in his grief.

### Who they are (2:11): 

Their names are Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar.

### What they do (2:12-13): 

Seeing Job, they grieve by wailing loudly and throwing dust into the
air. Then they sit with him on the ground for a week without saying a
word.

JOB 3-7
=======

> Job breaks his silence and wishes that he had never been born. Eliphaz
> responds and questions Job\'s innocence. He urges Job to accept God\'s
> discipline. Job maintains his innocence and asserts his right to
> complain. Job then asks God why he has bothered to make him his
> target.

JOB\'S DESPAIR (3:1-26) 
-----------------------

### I wish I had never been born (3:1-10): Job curses the day of his birth, wishing it could be blotted off the calendar. 

### I wish I had been stillborn (3:11-19): For Job the next best thing to never having been born would have been dying at birth. He laments that his mother let him live. 

### Why is life given to those in despair (3:20-26): Job wonders why life is given to the miserable. He has no peace or rest-only trouble. 

ELIPHAZ\'S DENUNCIATIONS (4:1-5:27): Eliphaz responds to Job\'s groaning. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Practice what you preach (4:1-6): Job has encouraged the weak in the past, and Eliphaz rebukes him for not heeding his own advice now.

### It came in a vision at night (4:12-17): Eliphaz claims to have received his knowledge from a spirit in the middle of the night! 

### Alive in the morning, dead by evening (4:18-21): Eliphaz claims that humans cannot be trusted; they are frail and die in ignorance. 

### The godless are born to grief (5:1-7): Again Job is said to be suffering for his sin. 

### Present your case to God (5:8-16): Eliphaz urges Job to bring his case before God, who is able to do anything. 

### Don\'t despise God\'s discipline (5:17-27): Eliphaz exhorts Job to trust that God will heal and protect him once he has punished him. 

JOB\'S DEFENSE (6:1-7:21): Job responds to Eliphaz\'s ill-informed rebuke. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Don\'t I have a right to complain? (6:1-7): 

Job argues that the greatness of his sorrow gives him a right to
complain.

### I wish that God would kill me (6:8-13): 

Though Job takes comfort in having never denied God\'s word, he still
wishes to die.

### You are unreliable (6:14-21): 

Job accuses his friend of being as unreliable as a brook that overflows
in the spring and dries up in the heat.

### Show me where I am wrong (6:22-24): 

Job challenges his critic Eliphaz to show him where he is guilty.

### Stop assuming my guilt (6:25-30): 

Job maintains his innocence and rebukes his friends for assuming that he
is guilty.

### Life is long and hard (7:1-5): 

Job is enduring his miserable life like a worker longing for the day to
end.

### Life is but a breath (7:6-10): 

Job describes life as being like a fleeting breath, for all people die
and never return.

### Why have you made me your target? (7:11-21): 

Job complains that God has terrified him with nightmares and has made
him his target. He asks why God should go to all this trouble for no
apparent reason and for such an insignificant person.

JOB 8-14
========

> Bildad rebukes Job and asserts that sin brings punishment. Job longs
> for a mediator to approach God with his complaints. Zophar rebukes Job
> and reminds him that God is beyond understanding. He urges Job to
> confess his sins, but Job reasserts his innocence. Job wants to argue
> his case with God himself.

### Confess your sins and find hope (11:13-20): Zophar, like the other friends, assumes that Job is suffering because of his sin. 

JOB\'S DEFENSE (12:1-14:22): Now Job must defend himself before Zophar. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### What a know-it-all! (12:1-2): Job sarcastically says that Zophar knows everything.

### Death is eternal (14:7-12): Job declares that people, unlike trees that sprout again after they are cut down, never rise again after death. 

### Oh, to live again after death (14:13-22): Job wishes that God would think of him after he dies; that would give him hope. But he does not seem to believe that God will do so. 

JOB 15-19
=========

> Eliphaz asserts that wise men have always believed that sin brings
> suffering. Job is frustrated with his friends and God; he longs for a
> mediator between him and God. Bildad says that terrors await the

JOB 20-24
=========

> Zophar tells Job that the wicked will be destroyed. Job insists that

### I resent your rebuke (20:1-3): Zophar feels insulted by Job\'s rebuke. 

### The ways of the wicked (20:4-29): Zophar returns to his theme of describing the sad fate of the wicked.

### Don\'t punish their children (21:19-21): Job rejects the theory that justice is served when the children of the ungodly are punished.

Job notes how humans have amazing ways to find and extract valuables

he\'d done. With these anguish-filled words Job concludes his defence.

JOB 32-37
=========

> Elihu denounces Job for claiming to be innocent and his friends for
> failing to answer him well. Elihu argues that God does not condemn
> unfairly, and he calls Job arrogant for thinking he is righteous.

> for questioning the Creator of the universe.

ELIHU\'S MONOLOGUE: WHY ELIHU SPEAKS (32:1-33:7): Another man named Elihu rebukes Job and his three other friends. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### An angry young man (32:1-15): Elihu, who is younger than Job and his friends, becomes angry with Job for refusing to acknowledge his sin. He rebukes the others for not giving adequate rebuttals to Job\'s answers.

### Listen to me, you wise men (34:1-4): Elihu calls for all who are wise to discern whether Job is right. 

### Job is bitter and arrogant (34:5-9): Elihu accuses Job of being arrogant in his claim to be innocent. He believes that Job seeks the companionship of evil people. 

### God repays people according to their deeds (34:10-32): This is why Elihu believes Job is arrogant. He argues that Job cannot be righteous, because he is suffering, and God does not unjustly punish the righteous and allow the wicked to go unpunished. 

### God does not answer to you (34:33-37): Elihu accuses Job of blasphemy and rebellion because he has accused God of allowing him to suffer unjustly. 

ELIHU\'S MONOLOGUE: WHAT JOB MUST REALIZE (35:1-36:21): Elihu continues to correct Job\'s thinking. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### You cannot force God\'s hand (35:1-8): Elihu tells Job that he should not expect God to respond to him simply because Job is righteous. Our actions cannot force God to do anything.

---------------------------------------------------

### Who understands God\'s ways? (36:22-37:13): Elihu catalogues many wonders in nature that show God\'s greatness. In view of such greatness, how can Job tell God what to do? 

### You know nothing (37:14-24): Elihu tells Job to stand in awe of God and show him reverence. 

JOB 38-42
=========

> The Lord humbles Job by asking him a series of questions about nature.
> Job acknowledges his insignificance, but the Lord continues with
> questions about two imposing creatures, the behemoth and the
> leviathan. Job humbly repents of his complaints against God. The Lord
> rebukes the three friends and restores Job\'s fortunes.

THE LORD\'S RESPONSE (38:1-39:30): The Lord finally speaks and humbles Job with a series of questions about nature.

#### First occasion (40:1-5): Job is humbled regarding his wisdom. 

##### The confrontation (40:1-2): The Lord asks Job for his answers to all these questions. 

##### The confession (40:3-5): \"I am nothing-how could I ever find the answers? I will put my hand over my mouth in silence.\" 

#### Second occasion (40:6-42:6): Job is humbled regarding his power. 

##### The confrontation (40:6-41:34): The Lord asks Job if he is able to capture two fearful creatures. 

###### The behemoth (40:15-24): It is difficult to be certain what this creature was. Some scholars believe it may have been a land dinosaur; others believe it was a hippopotamus. Whatever it was, it was very imposing. 

###### The leviathan (41:1-34): Some scholars believe this mysterious creature may have been an aquatic dinosaur; others believe it might have been a crocodile. 

##### The confession (42:1-6): Job admits his insignificance in comparison to the Lord\'s power. 

### His rewards (42:7-17): After Job recognizes his proper position before the Lord, the Lord restores his fortunes. 

#### The rebuke (42:7-9): The Lord rebukes the three friends for their false accusations of Job. He instructs them to make a sacrifice and says that Job will pray for them. 

#### The restoration (42:10-17): After Job prays for his friends, the Lord restores his fortunes to him, giving him twice as much as he had before. He blesses Job with seven more sons and three more daughters. Job lives 140 more years!
