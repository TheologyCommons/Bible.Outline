GALATIANS 3 
===========

Paul offers five arguments, all demonstrating the sufficiency of
justification by faith alone.

THE ARGUMENT FROM THE GALATIANS THEMSELVES (3:1-5) 
--------------------------------------------------

### They became believers by turning to the gospel (3:1-2). 

### They are becoming bewitched by turning from the gospel (3:3-5).

GALATIANS 4 
===========

In an attempt to free the Galatians from the terrible yoke of legalism,
Paul appeals to their heads and their hearts.

PAUL\'S \"HEAD\" WORDS (4:1-7, 21-31): 
--------------------------------------

He offers two illustrations.

### A legal illustration (4:1-7) 

#### The Roman father and his son (4:1-2) 

##### The frustration (4:1): 

Until he comes of age, the son can enjoy very little of his father\'s
estate.

##### The frustration (4:3): 

While under the law, they enjoyed very little of the Father\'s estate.

##### The freedom (4:4-7): 

Upon coming of age (effected by Christ\'s death), they can enjoy all of
their Father\'s estate.

### An Old Testament illustration (4:21-31): 

Paul uses the example of Hagar and Sarah, two Old Testament women, to
allegorize the law of Moses and the grace of God.

#### Hagar (an allegory of the law) (4:21-22a, 23a, 24-25, 29a, 30-31a)

--------------------------------

### The rebuke (4:8-11): 

Again he faults them for their return to legalism.

### The review (4:12-18) 

#### Paul reminds them that they once were his friends (4:12-15).

Paul will again suffer the pains of childbirth until Christ is fully
developed in them.
