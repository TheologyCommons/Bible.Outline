God\'s parables, but not the foolish.

it, thus allowing Satan to steal it from them.

encountering persecution.

##### Thorn-infested soil (4:18-19): 

This soil represents those who allow the deceitfulness of riches to
snuff out the seed.

##### Fertile soil (4:20): 

This soil represents those who both hear and understand, permitting the
seed to produce abundantly.

### Parable of the lamp on a stand (4:21-25): 

Jesus says the more one allows his or her light to shine, the clearer
the truths in the parable will become!

### Parable of the growing seed (4:26-29): 

God\'s word, once it takes root in the heart of a believer, will in and
by itself bring forth much fruit!
