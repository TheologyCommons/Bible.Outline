HAGGAI 1-2 
==========

Haggai preaches three messages to the returning Jewish remnant: the
first, to their hands; the second, to their hearts; and the third, to
their heads.

HIS AUGUST MESSAGE (1:1-15): 
----------------------------

Directed to the people\'s hands, it says, Reform.

### God\'s exhortation (1:2, 4-11): 

Build the Temple!

#### The people\'s complacency (1:2): 

\"The people are saying, \'The time has not yet come to rebuild the
LORD\'s house-the Temple.\"\'

#### The Lord\'s chastisement (1:4-11) 

##### His reminder (1:4-6, 9-11) 

###### The people\'s materialism (1:4-5): 

They live in luxurious homes while the Temple lies in ruins.

###### The people\'s misery (1:6, 9-11): 

They plant much but harvest little. They attempt many things but fail in
everything.

##### His reassurance (1:7-8): 

If you build, I\'ll bless!

### God\'s exhorters (1:1, 3, 12-15): 

God now speaks through three of his choice servants: Zerubbabel
(Judah\'s governor), Jeshua (or Joshua-the high priest), and Haggai
(Judah\'s prophet).

HIS OCTOBER MESSAGE (2:1-9): 
----------------------------

Directed to the people\'s hearts, it says, Patience: There is weeping
and rejoicing at the modest second Temple\'s dedication, for some old
men remember the glories of the first one (Solomon\'s Temple). In light
of this, Haggai attempts to encourage all as he speaks of the future
magnificent millennial Temple.

### The buildings (2:1-5, 9) 

#### The first and second Temples (2:1-5): 

Haggai tells them to take courage, for God\'s presence among them is far
more important than the size of any earthly Temple.

#### The future Temple (2:9): 

The people are reassured that the millennial Temple will be the biggest
and best of all.

### The builder (2:6-8): 

God himself will build the future Temple. However, this glorious event
will be preceded by two key events:

#### The nations\' chastening (2:6-7a) 

#### The Messiah\'s coming (2:7b-8) 

HIS DECEMBER MESSAGE (2:10-23): 
-------------------------------

Directed to the people\'s heads, it says, Ponder: Two facts Haggai wants
the people to think about are

### Judah\'s contamination (2:10-19) 

#### Past problems (2:10-17) 

##### The examples (2:10-13) 

###### God\'s first question (2:10-12) 

####### The question (2:10-11): 

If a person carrying a holy offering brushes against an object, does
that object become holy?

####### The answer (2:12): 

No, for holiness does not pass on to other things that way.

###### God\'s second question (2:13) 

####### The question (2:13a): 

If a person defiled by contact with a dead body touches an object, does
that object become defiled?

####### The answer (2:13b): 

Yes!

##### The explanation (2:14-17): 

Haggai applies this principle to the people, saying that their sinful
ways have contaminated their consecrated offerings to God, resulting in
crop failures, famine, etc.

#### Future promises (2:18-19): 

Because the people repent of all this and lay the Temple\'s foundation,
God will now abundantly bless them.

### Zerubbabel\'s elevation (2:20-23): 

God promises to honor and elevate this faithful governor of Judah
someday. This will occur

#### After the Great Tribulation (2:20-22) 

#### During the glorious Millennium (2:23)
