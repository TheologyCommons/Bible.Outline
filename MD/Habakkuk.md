HABAKKUK 1-3 
------------

Habakkuk searches for answers to two questions and is reassured by God.

### THE SEARCH (1:1-2:13, 15-20): 

Habakkuk asks God two questions.

#### The first Q&A (1:1-11) 

##### Q: Will Judah be punished? (1:1-4): 

Habakkuk is troubled over:

###### Jehovah\'s silence (1:1-2): 

Habakkuk\'s prayers about the terrible violence in the land have gone
unanswered.

###### Judah\'s sins (1:3-4): 

There is destruction, violence, arguing, fighting, and injustice
everywhere.

##### A: Judah will be punished (1:5-11). 

###### The soldiers (1:5-6): 

God will send the Babylonians to chasten his people.

###### The severity (1:7): 

These warriors are notorious for their cruelty.

###### The symbols (1:8-9): 

Their soldiers are like

####### Swift leopards (1:8a) 

####### Fierce wolves (1:8b) 

####### Devouring eagles (1:8c-9) 

###### The scorn (1:10-11): 

They laugh at their enemies, holding them in great contempt.

#### The second Q&A (1:12-17; 2:1-13, 15-20) 

##### Q: Will Babylon be punished? (1:12-17): 

Babylon is even more wicked than Judah.

##### A: Babylon will be punished (2:1-13, 15-20). 

###### The record (2:1-2): 

God tells Habakkuk to write the answer on a tablet in large, clear
letters so that everyone can get the message.

###### The reassurance (2:3): 

Even though it might appear that God is delaying judgment, Babylon will
eventually be crushed.

###### The righteous (2:4): 

Until then, those in exile should live by faith.

###### The reasons (2:5-13, 15-19): 

God will judge Babylon for her many sins:

####### Drunkenness and greed (2:5) 

####### Brutal treatment of the nations (2:6) 

####### The shedding of blood (2:7-13) 

####### Being merchants of terror (2:15-16) 

####### Destroying other lands (2:17) 

####### Gross idolatry (2:18-19) 

###### The respect (2:20): 

\"The LORD is in his holy Temple. Let all the earth be silent before
him.\"

### THE SOLUTION (2:14; 3:1-19): Habakkuk is reassured. 

#### Because of what he has heard (2:14; 3:1-2) 

##### About God\'s fame and deeds (3:1-2) 

##### About the entire earth someday being filled with God\'s glory (2:14) 

#### Because of what he now sees (3:3-19): 

In essence, he views the majesty of the Almighty moving across the
earth.

##### God\'s splendor (3:3-4): 

His glory is as the sunrise. \"Rays of brilliant light flash from his
hands.\"

##### God\'s strength (3:5-12, 14-15) 

###### He judges with pestilence and plague (3:5). 

###### He shakes the nations, shatters the mountains, and levels the hills (3:6). 

###### He utterly crushes his enemies (3:7-12, 14-15). 

##### God\'s salvation (3:13): 

He delivers his chosen people.

##### God\'s security (3:16-19): 

Because of all he has seen, heard, and experienced, Habakkuk determines
that he will:

###### Trust God in time of fear (3:16) 

###### Trust God in time of famine (3:17-19)
