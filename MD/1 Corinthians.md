1 Corinthians 1 
===============

Paul begins his first letter to the Corinthian church by giving thanks
to God for the many gifts this church has received from the Lord. He
then addresses two problems facing the Corinthian church.

THE PERSONAL GREETINGS FROM PAUL (1:1-3) 
----------------------------------------

### The recipients (1:1-2) 

#### Paul writes to the Corinthian believers (1:1-2a). 

#### Paul writes to all believers (1:2b). 

### The blessing (1:3): 

Paul wishes them grace and peace.

THE PRAYER OF PAUL (1:4-9) 
--------------------------

### Paul thanks God for the gifts God has given the Corinthian believers (1:4-7): 

They received all the spiritual gifts.

### Paul thanks God for the guarantee God gave the Corinthian believers (1:8-9): 

This guarantee refers to their eternal security.

THE PROBLEMS ADDRESSED BY PAUL (1:10-31): 
-----------------------------------------

Paul discusses two of the numerous problems confronting the Corinthian
church.

### They are elevating human leaders (1:10-17). 

#### The individuals (1:10-12): 

Some are fans of Paul; some, of Apollos; and others, of Simon Peter.

#### The issue (1:14-16): 

Apparently the argument consists mainly of who baptized them.

#### The insanity (1:13, 17): 

Paul rebukes them, hitting his own \"fan club\" the hardest.

##### \"Was I, Paul, crucified for you?\" (1:13a). 

##### \"Were any of you baptized in the name of Paul?\" (1:13b). 

##### \"Christ didn\'t send me to baptize, but to preach the Good News\" (1:17). 

### They are exalting human wisdom (1:18-31): 

Paul contrasts and compares the egocentric wisdom of people with the
eternal wisdom of God.

#### The response to God\'s wisdom (1:18, 22-23) 

##### In regard to unbelieving Jews and Gentiles (1:18, 22-23) 

###### To the Jews who demand supernatural signs, it becomes a stumbling block (1:18a, 22a, 23a). 

###### To the Gentiles who depend upon vain philosophy, it becomes foolishness (1:18b, 22b, 23b). 

##### In regard to believing Jews and Gentiles (1:18c, 24-25): 

It represents both the power and wisdom of God.

#### The results of God\'s wisdom (1:19-21) 

##### It is used to destroy worldly wisdom (1:19-20). 

##### It is used to deliver repenting sinners (1:21). 

#### The reason for God\'s wisdom (1:26-31): 

Why did God choose the Cross to save people?

##### Paul\'s overview (1:27-31): 

God delights in using foolish, weak, lowly, and despised things to
nullify the wise, strong, exalted, and respected things.

##### Paul\'s observation (1:26): 

He tactfully reminds the arrogant Corinthians of their own lack of
worldly influence and academic wisdom!

1 Corinthians 2 
===============

Paul reflects on his founding of the church in Corinth and reminds the
Corinthian believers of several facts in regard to the Cross.

THE MESSAGE OF THE CROSS IS NOT OF THIS WORLD (2:1-6). 
------------------------------------------------------

### The apostle\'s resolve (2:1-4) 

#### What he determines not to do (2:1): 

He will not depend on eloquence or education in his preaching.

#### What he determines to do (2:2-4): 

He will depend completely on the power of the Holy Spirit.

### The apostle\'s reason (2:5-6): 

He will do this so their faith will rest on God\'s Word and not on his
wisdom.

THE MESSAGE OF THE CROSS WAS ORDAINED BEFORE THIS WORLD (2:7-8). 
----------------------------------------------------------------

### Handcrafted for the saved (2:7): 

This involves God\'s wise plan to bring believers into the glories of
heaven.

### Hidden from the unsaved (2:8): 

Had they known the truth, they would not have crucified the Lord of
glory.

THE MESSAGE OF THE CROSS WAS RESERVED FOR THE HEIRS OF THIS WORLD (2:9-16). 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Concealed from the human spirit (2:9): 

No mortal can ever see, hear, or even imagine what wonderful things God
has prepared for those who love him.

### Revealed by the Holy Spirit (2:10-16) 

#### What he does (2:10-12): 

He reveals to us God\'s deepest secrets.

#### How he does it (2:13-16): 

This is accomplished through the Scriptures.

1 Corinthians 3 
===============

Paul again reminds the Corinthians not to elevate teachers of the Word
of God over the Word itself.

THE \"BABY\" CHRISTIANS IN THE CORINTHIAN CHURCH (3:1-10): 
----------------------------------------------------------

Paul addresses some squabbling believers in this assembly.

### Paul\'s criticism (3:1-2) 

#### What he hopes to do (3:1): 

The apostle wants to give them the solid meat of the Word.

#### What he has to do (3:2): 

Because of their carnality and immaturity, he can only feed them milk.

### Paul\'s correction (3:3-10) 

#### Their sinful view of Christian leaders (3:3-4): 

They are looking to men (like Paul and Apollos) instead of to Christ.

#### His scriptural view of Christian leaders (3:5-10) 

##### What the leaders do (3:5a, 6a, 7a, 8-10): 

They can only sow and water the spiritual seed.

##### What the Lord does (3:5b, 6b, 7b): 

God alone can cause the crop to grow.

THE BEMA JUDGMENT AND THE CORINTHIAN CHURCH (3:11-23) 
-----------------------------------------------------

### The works (3:11-15): 

Paul says alI believers will someday stand before an elevated platform
(called a \"bema\") to be tested in regard to their service for Christ.

#### The objects in this test (3:11-13): 

Our works here are classified as gold, silver, jewels, wood, hay, and
straw.

#### The outcome of this test (3:14-15) 

##### The owner of the gold, silver, and jeweled works will receive a reward (3:14). 

##### The owner of the wood, hay, and straw works will receive no reward (3:15). 

### The warning (3:16-23) 

#### Don\'t defile your temple (3:16-17): 

God regards our bodies as temples.

#### Don\'t deceive yourselves (3:18-21): 

Paul warns not to depend on earthly wisdom or human leaders but on God
himself.

#### You belong to Christ as Christ belongs to God (3:22-23). 

1 Corinthians 4 
===============

Paul writes about the office and duties of a steward. A steward is a
trusted servant whom the master has appointed to conduct his business
matters in his absence.

THE CONTRASTS BETWEEN FAITHFUL AND FAITHLESS STEWARDS (4:1-13) 
--------------------------------------------------------------

### The faithless steward (4:6-8, 10b, 10d-10e) 

#### This person is filled with pride (4:6-7). 

#### This person is presumptuous (4:8). 

#### This person is wise in his own eyes (4:10b). 

#### This person is physically strong (4:10d). 

#### This person is well thought of by the world (4:10e). 

### The faithful steward (4:1-5, 9-10a, I0c, 10f-13) 

#### This person possesses a clear conscience (4:1-4). 

#### This person does not judge others (4:5). 

#### This person becomes a spectacle (4:9). 

#### This person is written off as a fool (4:10a). 

#### This person may be physically weak (4:10c). 

#### This person is laughed at by the world (4:10f). 

#### This person is often hungry, thirsty, and without warm clothes (4:11a). 

#### This person is brutally treated and homeless (4:11b). 

#### This person is acquainted with backbreaking labor (4:12a). 

#### This person blesses his or her enemies (4:12b, 13a). 

#### This person is looked upon as the world\'s garbage (4:13b). 

THE COUNSEL TO THE FAITHFUL AND FAITHLESS STEWARDS (4:14-21) 
------------------------------------------------------------

### Paul\'s appeal (4:14-16) 

#### His reminder (4:14-15): 

The apostle reminds the Corinthian believers that he led them to Christ.

#### His request (4:16):

\"Follow my example and do as I do.\"

##### Paul\'s ambassador (4:17): 

He will soon be sending Timothy their way to assist them.

##### Paul\'s appearance (4:18-21): 

The apostle plans to visit them personally in the near future.

1 Corinthians 5 
===============

Paul writes about church discipline.

THE NEED FOR DISCIPLINE (5:1): 
------------------------------

There is a terrible sin prevalent in the Corinthian church.

### The notoriousness of their sin (5:1a): 

It is something so evil that even the heathen won\'t permit it.

### The nature of their sin (5:1b): 

A member is living in immorality with his own mother (or possibly
stepmother).

THE REFUSAL TO DISCIPLINE (5:2): 
--------------------------------

Due to pride and indifference, the church has not removed this man.

THE COMMAND TO DISCIPLINE (5:3-5): 
----------------------------------

Paul orders the church to call a special meeting to resolve this issue.

### The authority (5:3-4): 

He reminds them that the Savior has given authority to the local church.

### The action (5:5) 

#### What the church is to do (5:5a): They must hand this guilty man over to Satan. 

#### Why the church is to do it (5:5b): This will hopefully bring him to repentance so that his spirit might be saved. 

THE REASONS FOR DISCIPLINE (5:5-8) 
----------------------------------

### To bring the offender back to God (This has already been seen 5:5.) 

### To keep the offense from spreading in the church (5:6-7): Thus, the church is to: 

#### Cut out the cancer (5:6-7a) 

#### Continue in the Savior (5:7b) 

### To keep the celebration of Christ, the Passover Lamb, pure and true (5:8) 

THE EXTENT OF DISCIPLINE (5:9-13) 
---------------------------------

### This discipline involves only church members (5:9-11). 

#### The church has no right to judge godless outsiders (5:9-10). 

#### The church has the responsibility to avoid godless outsiders (5:11). B. 

### The discipline involves all church members (5:12-13). 

1 Corinthians 6 
===============

Paul deals with two sins plaguing the Corinthian church.

LAWSUITS (6:1-11) 
-----------------

### The facts (6:1, 6): 

Some Christians in Corinth are taking fellow believers to court before
pagan judges to settle petty matters.

### The folly (6:2-5, 7-11): 

Paul condemns this action on three accounts.

#### It is illogical (6:2-5): 

Inasmuch as believers will someday judge angels, can they not be
expected to settle their differences down here with the help of other
Christians?

#### It is illegal (6:7-8): 

Apparently they are using the court system to defraud each other.

#### It is inexcusable (6:9-11). 

##### God has forgiven them of so many horrible sins (6:11). 

##### Could they not forgive one another of a few lesser sins (6:9-10)? 

LASCIVIOUSNESS (6:12-20): 
-------------------------

Paul warns them to control their bodies in all areas.

### The realms (6:12-18) 

#### In regard to food (6:12-13a): 

In a nutshell, don\'t let food master you.

#### In regard to sexual matters (6:13b-18): 

We are to flee from sexual immorality.

### The rationale (6:19-20): 

Our body is God\'s temple, paid for by the blood of Jesus.

1 Corinthians 7
===============

Paul talks about marriage.

MARRIAGE-SOME GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS (7:1-2, 7-9, 17-24, 29-35) 
-------------------------------------------------------------

### The argument (7:1-2, 7-9, 32-35): 

Is it better to be married than not to be married?

#### The advantages of marriage (7:2, 7, 9) 

##### It helps prevent immoral actions and attitudes (7:2, 9). 

##### It is God\'s will for many people to marry (7:7). 

#### The advantages of remaining single (7:1, 8, 32-35): 

For the most part, a single person is free to devote all his or her
attention to the work of the Lord, having no need to share time with a
spouse or children.

### The answer (7:17-24, 29-31): 

Which course is the best? It depends totally on God\'s perfect plan for
each believer.

#### God\'s will must govern any decisions concerning marriage (7:17). 

#### Pleasing God is the supreme objective (7:18-19). 

#### We are not our own but have been bought and paid for by Christ (7:20-24). 

#### Even if married, Christ must occupy first place in our life (7:29-31). 

MARRIAGE-SOME SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS: (7:3-6, 10-16, 25-28, 36-40): Paul now addresses four groups. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Saved couples (7:3-6, 10-11) 

#### Both are to submit their bodies to each other (7:3-4). 

#### Both must agree if physical intimacy is set aside for a while to facilitate prayer and fasting (7:5-6). 

#### Both must strive to stay together and not divorce (7:10-11). 

### Spiritually mixed couples (7:12-16) 

#### The saved spouse should continue living with the unsaved spouse if possible (7:12-13). 

#### This action may result in the salvation of the unsaved spouse (7:14). 

#### The saved spouse should allow the unsaved spouse to depart if he or she insists on it (7:1516). 

### Virgins (7:25-28, 36-38): 

Paul advises the unmarried not to rush into marriage.

### A widow (7:39-40): 

She is free to marry another believer.

1 Corinthians 8 
===============

In the next three chapters, Paul deals with the subject of Christian
liberty. Here Paul answers a question the Corinthian church asked him
concerning food.

THE CONFUSION (8:4a): 
---------------------

Is it right for a Christian to eat meat that has been sacrificed to
idols?

THE CLARIFICATION (8:4b-6, 8) 
-----------------------------

### There are many idols, all of which represent gods who do not exist (8:4b-5). 

### There is only one true God, the creator of all things and the giver of life (8:6). 

### In light of the above, there is no connection between food and spirituality (8:8). 

THE CONCERN (8:7): 
------------------

Paul warns, however, that not all Christians fully realize this, and
some are upset when other believers eat such meat.

THE CHALLENGE (8:1-3, 9-12) 
---------------------------

### Don\'t become a stumbling block to other Christians (8:9-12). 

#### To do so is to sin against your weaker brother (8:9-11). 

#### To do so is to sin against your Savior (8:12). 

### Do become a stepping-stone (8:1-3): 

Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.

THE CONCLUSION (8:13): 
----------------------

Paul says, \"If what I eat is going to make another Christian sin, I
will never eat meat again as long as I love-for I don\'t want to make
another Christian stumble.\"

1 Corinthians 9 
===============

Paul offers himself as a proper role model.

CHRISTIAN LIBERTY-PAUL\'S APPROACH (9:1-23): 
--------------------------------------------

How the apostle views his liberty in Christ and his rights as a
believer.

### The basis of his rights (9:1-3) 

#### He is an apostle of Christ (9:1). 

#### He has seen Christ (9:1b). 

#### He has led many to Christ (9:1c-3). 

### The extent of his rights (9:4-12a, 13-14): 

Paul\'s rights include:

#### The right of hospitality (9:4): 

Paul has earned the right to be entertained by other believers.

#### The right to travel with his family (9:5-6) 

#### The right to enjoy financial support (9:7-12a, 13-14) 

##### A soldier is paid for his services (9:7a). 

##### A vineyard owner eats from the grapes he harvests (9:7b). 

##### A shepherd drinks from the milk of his flock (9:7c). 

##### A farmer shares in the fruit of his crops (9:8-12a). 

##### A priest partakes from the animal sacrifices he offers (9:13-14). 

### The use of his rights (9:12b, 15-18, 20-22): 

How Paul employs his rights.

#### What he does not do (9:12b, 15-18): 

Paul chooses not to use his rights but supplies his own needs.

#### What he does (9:19-22a): 

He becomes a servant to everyone.

##### To the Jews he becomes like a Jew (9:19-20). 

##### To the Gentiles he becomes like a Gentile (9:21). 

##### To the weak he becomes weak (9:22a). 

#### Why he does it (9:22b-23): 

He becomes all things to all people so that he might save some.

### CHRISTIAN LIBERTY (9:24-27): 

Paul makes an appeal.

#### The apostle\'s challenge (9:24-26) 

##### Run to win the race (9:24-25). 

##### Fight to win the battle (9:26). 

#### The apostle\'s concern (9:27) 

##### What he does (9:27a): 

He keeps his body in subjection by punishing it like an athlete would
do.

##### Why he does it (9:27b): 

He does not want sin to creep in and disqualify him from the battle.

1 Corinthians 10 
================

Paul writes concerning Israel\'s tragic failure in the past and provides
both examples and exhortations.

EXAMPLES (10:1-10): 
-------------------

The factors that led to Israel\'s destruction.

### The advantages enjoyed by Israel (10:1-4) 

#### They were led by the cloud of God\'s glory (10:1). 

#### The waters of the Red Sea parted for them (10:2). 

#### They were supernaturally provided with food and water (10:3-4a). 

#### Christ himself accompanied them (10:4b). 

### The apostasy committed by Israel (10:5-10) 

#### They displeased God, and many were killed (10:5-6). 

#### They were guilty of idolatry (10:7): 

They engaged in pagan revelry.

#### They were guilty of immorality (10:8): 

Twenty-three thousand of them died in one day.

#### They were guilty of impunity (10:9): 

They died of snakebites.

#### They were guilty of ingratitude (10:10): 

They grumbled, and God sent the angel of death.

EXHORTATIONS (10:11-33): The factors that lead to our deliverance. 
------------------------------------------------------------------

### The faithfulness of God (10:11-13): 

Paul speaks of God\'s faithfulness in the hour of temptation.

#### God has not promised to shield us from temptation (10:11-12). 

#### God has promised to see us through temptation (10:13). 

### The fellowship with God (10:14-22): Among all of Israel\'s sins, idolatry was apparently the most serious. Paul explains and contrasts divine fellowship with devilish fellowship. 

#### Divine fellowship (10:14-18): 

This fellowship is especially seen through the Lord\'s Supper, which
expresses the unity among the members and their participation in the
blood and body of Christ.

#### Devilish fellowship (10:19-22): 

The same is true in pagan worship, where sacrifices are actually offered
up to demons.

### Freedom in God (10:23-33): Paul addresses two issues. 

#### What believers can do (10:23): 

They can partake, for this practice is permissible.

#### What believers should do (10:24-33): 

Since some weaker Christians might be offended by certain actions,
mature believers should:

##### Do what they do for the good of all (10:24-30, 32-33) 

##### Do what they do for the glory of God (10:31) 

1 Corinthians 11 
================

Paul describes just how children of God should conduct themselves in the
house of God.

GUIDANCE CONCERNING CLOTHING (11:1-16): 
---------------------------------------

The desired proper appearance.

### The pattern (11:1-3) 

#### The role model (11:1-2): 

Paul instructs believers to follow his examples just as he follows
Christ\'s.

#### The relationships (11:3) 

##### The head of the woman is man (11:3b). 

##### The head of the man is the Savior (11:3a). 

##### The head of the Savior is the Father (11:3c). 

### The parties (11:4-16) 

#### Rules concerning the man (11:4, 7-9, 14) 

##### His head is to be uncovered (11:4, 7-9). 

###### Demonstrating his relationship to his Savior (11:4, 7) 

###### Demonstrating his relationship to his spouse (11:8-9) 

##### His hair is to be cut (11:14). 

#### Rules concerning the woman (11:5-6, 10, 13, 15-16) 

##### Her head is to be covered (11:5, 10, 13). 

###### Demonstrating her submission to her Savior (11:13) 

###### Demonstrating her submission to her spouse (11:5) 

###### Demonstrating her submission to the angels (11:10) 

##### Her hair is not to be cut (11:6, 15-16): It should not be shorn or shaved. 

#### Rules concerning both (11:11-12) 

##### The woman is not to be independent of the man (11:11). 

##### The man is not to be independent of the woman (11:12). 

Guidance Concerning Communion (11:17-34): 
-----------------------------------------

The Corinthian believers are not observing the Lord\'s Table as they
should.

### The perversion (11:17-22) 

#### They separate into their own little groups (11:17-20). 

#### They share with no one else (11:21-22). 

### The pattern (11:23-25): 

Paul describes the original Lord\'s Supper as conducted by Jesus in the
upper room.

#### What the Savior did (11:23, 25a) 

##### He held up the bread (11:23). 

##### He held up the cup (11:25a). 

#### What the Savior said (11:24, 25b) 

##### Concerning the bread (11:24): 

\"This is my body, which is given for you.\"

##### Concerning the cup (11:25b): 

\"This cup is the new covenant between God and you, sealed by the
shedding of my blood.\"

### The purpose (11:26, 28): Any Lord\'s Table involves a threefold look. 

#### It serves as a backward look to the cross (11:26a). 

#### It serves as an inward look to the conscience (11:28). 

#### It serves as a forward look to the crown (11:26b). 

### The penalty (11:27, 29-30): 

Any believer who partakes in an unworthy manner is guilty and risks
punishment.

#### To eat and drink God\'s judgment on oneself (11:27-29) 

#### To be divinely judged with physical sickness (11:30a) 

#### To be divinely judged with physical death (11:30b) 

### The profit (11:31-34) 

#### It can be used for judging ourselves (11:31-32). 

#### It can be used forgiving ourselves (11:33-34). 

1 Corinthians 12 
================

Paul discusses spiritual gifts.

THE COMMAND TO KNOW THE GIFTS (12:1-3): 
---------------------------------------

This knowledge will help dispel any ignorance concerning the giver of
the gifts.

THE SOURCE OF THE GIFTS (12:4-6, 11): 
-------------------------------------

They are imparted by the Holy Spirit.

THE EXTENT OF THE GIFTS (12:7, 29-30) 
-------------------------------------

### Each believer is given at least one gift (12:7). 

### No believer is given all the gifts (12:29-30). 

THE DIVERSITY OF THE GIFTS (12:8-10, 28) 
----------------------------------------

### Wisdom (12:8a) 

### Knowledge (12:8b) 

### Faith (12:9a) 

### Healing (12:9b, 28e) 

### Miracles (12:10a, 28d) 

### Prophecy (12:10b, 28b) 

### Discernment (12:10c) 

### Tongues (12:10d, 28h) 

### Interpretation of Tongues (12:10e) 

### Apostleship (12:28a) 

### Teaching (12:28c) 

### Helping (12:28f) 

### Administration (12:28g) 

THE ANALOGY OF THE GIFTS (12:12-27): 
------------------------------------

Paul compares the body of Christ and its many spiritually gifted members
to the human body with its many physical members.

###  Each member in both bodies performs a vital task (12:12-13, 18). 

### No member in either body can be independent of the other members (12:14-17, 19-24). 

#### The foot and the ear are not to show envy toward the hand and the eye (12:14-17). 

#### The eye and the head are not to show pride toward the hands and the feet (12:21). 

### Each member in both bodies is to rejoice and suffer with the other members (12:19-20, 22-27). 

THE GREATEST OF THE GIFTS (12:31): Paul ends this chapter by promising to show \"the most excellent way,\" which he does in chapter 13. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 Corinthians 13 
================

This is the famous love chapter.

THE IMPORTANCE OF LOVE (13:1-3) 
-------------------------------

### The gift of tongues is useless without it (13:1). 

### The gift of prophecy is useless without it (13:2a). 

### The gift of knowledge is useless without it (13:2b). 

### The gift of faith is useless without it (13:2c). 

### The gift of giving is useless without it (13:3). 

THE IMPECCABILITY OF LOVE (13:4-7) 
----------------------------------

### In relation to saints (13:4a): 

It is patient and kind, not jealous.

### In relation to self (13:4b-5a): 

It is not boastful, proud, or rude, and it never seeks its own way.

### In relation to sin (13:5b-6): 

It is not irritable, nor does it keep a record of wrongs; it is never
glad about injustice or unrighteousness but rejoices with the truth.

### In relation to situations (13:7): 

It never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures
through every circumstance.

THE INDESTRUCTIBILITY OF LOVE (13:8-12) 
---------------------------------------

### Unlike the other gifts, love is permanent (13:8). 

#### Prophecy will cease (13:8a). 

#### Tongues will cease (13:8b). 

#### Knowledge will cease (13:8c). 

### Unlike other gifts, love is complete (13:9-12): 

Paul offers two illustrations.

#### The child/adult illustration (13:9-11) 

##### The gifts, if used without love, may be likened to the attitudes and actions of an immature child (13:9-11a). 

##### Love may be likened to the attitudes and actions of a mature adult (13:11b). 

#### The mirror/face-to-face illustration (13:12) 

##### In the present, through the gifts, we see but a mirror like reflection of God (13:12a). 

##### In the future, through love, we will see God face-to-face (13:12b). 

THE INVINCIBILITY OF LOVE (13:13) 
---------------------------------

### Faith and hope are among God\'s greatest gifts (13:13a). 

### Love is God\'s greatest gift (13:13b). 

1 Corinthians 14 
================

Paul contrasts and compares the gifts of tongues and prophecy.

THE GIFT OF PROPHECY (14:1, 3, 4b-12, 18-19, 29-33) 
---------------------------------------------------

### The admonition to seek this gift (14:1): 

Love should be the highest goal, but prophecy should be sought after as
well.

### The advantages of this gift (14:3, 4b-6, 18-19) 

#### It strengthens, encourages, and comforts believers (14:3). 

#### It edifies the entire church (14:4b). 

#### It is Paul\'s personal choice for the Corinthian church (14:5). 

#### It is Paul\'s most effective way to help all the churches (14:6). 

#### In fact, he feels this gift is 2,000 times more effective than the gift of tongues (14:18-19). 

### The analogies concerning this gift (14:7-12): 

Paul offers three analogies, each proving the superiority of prophecy
over tongues.

#### From the music world (14:7): 

No one recognizes the melody unless each note is sounded clearly.

#### From the military world (14:8): 

An unclear call to battle is useless.

#### From the daily world (14:9-12): 

Unclear language is useless language.

### The admonitions concerning this gift (14:29-33) 

#### Only two or three people should prophesy in a service, and the others should evaluate what is said (14:29). 

#### If one person is prophesying and another receives a divine revelation, the first person should allow the second to speak (14:30-31). 

#### Those who prophesy must remain in control of their spirit so that they can wait their turn to speak (4:32-33). 

THE GIFT OF TONGUES (14:2, 4a, 13-17, 21-25, 27-35) 
---------------------------------------------------

### The reasons for this gift (14:2, 4a, 21-25) 

#### In regard to believers (14:2, 4a) 

##### The speaker utters mysteries to God that are unknown to man (14:2). 

##### The speaker edifies himself (14:4a). 

#### In regard to unbelievers (14:21-25) 

##### The prediction (14:21): 

Paul quotes from Isaiah, where the prophet warned that God would allow
foreign-speaking nations (Assyria, Babylon, etc.) to punish his sinful
people (Isa. 28:11-12).

##### The purpose (14:22): 

The gift of tongues is thus a sign of judgment for unbelieving Israel.

##### The problem (14:23): 

Paul warns against the entire church\'s exercising the gift of tongues,
lest an unsaved person come in and conclude that all are out of their
minds.

##### The persuasion (14:24-25): 

However, if the gift of prophecy (preaching) is in effect, that unsaved
person might be convinced to accept Christ.

### The rules governing this gift (14:13-17, 27-32, 34-35) 

#### Those speaking in tongues should pray that what is said might be correctly interpreted (14:1314). 

#### The one praying and singing with his spirit is also to do both with his mind (14:15-17). 

#### No more than two or three should speak in tongues at any service (14:27a). 

#### They should speak one at a time (14:27b). 

#### Someone must be present to interpret, or they should keep quiet (14:27c-28). 

#### Women are not to speak in tongues or prophesy in the church meetings (14:34-35). 

THE GUIDELINES FOR BOTH GIFTS (14:20, 33, 36-40): 
-------------------------------------------------

Paul offers a fourfold conclusion covering both gifts.

### Be as innocent as infants and as intelligent as adults in exercising these gifts (14:20). 

### These gifts and all others should be used solely for the edification of others (14:26). 

### Be eager to prophesy, and don\'t forbid tongues (14:39). 

### Do everything in a fitting and orderly way (14:33, 40). 

### Obey what Paul has written, for these are God\'s commands (14:36-38). 

1 Corinthians 15 
================

Paul writes about the resurrection of Christ and the resurrection of
believers.

THE PROMINENCE OF THE RESURRECTION (15:14) 
------------------------------------------

### The resurrection of Christ is the focal point in reference to salvation (15:1-2). 

### The resurrection of Christ is the focal point in reference to the Scriptures (15:3-4).

-------------------------------------------------------

The doctrine of the resurrection is under attack.

### The charge (15:12): 

The enemies of the gospel deny it.

### The conclusion (15:13-19, 29-32): 

If there is no resurrection, one must be forced to accept the following
horrible conclusions:

#### In regard to Christ (15:13, 16): 

The Easter story is a lie.

#### In regard to gospel preaching (15:14a): 

It is useless.

#### In regard to gospel preachers (15:15): 

They are all liars.

##### We are still in our sin (15:17). 

##### We are the most miserable of all creatures (15:19). 

##### Those who live, suffer, and die for Christ are fools (15:29-31). 

#### In regard to departed believers (15:18):

We should live it up, for tomorrow we may die!

unbelievers about the resurrection.

This terrible foe is physical death.

#### The future Kingdom will be established (15:25-27). 

The Pattern of the Resurrection (15:35-41): 
-------------------------------------------

through analogies.

### The difference between a planted seed and a harvested seed (15:35-38): 

A planted seed is dead, but a harvested seed is alive.
