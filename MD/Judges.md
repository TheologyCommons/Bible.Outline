==========

> apostasy and judgments is given.

THE CAMPAIGNS OF ISRAEL (1:1-36) 
--------------------------------

### Military campaign of Judah (1:1-20) 

#### The merger of Simeon (1:1-3): 

The men of Simeon\'s tribe agree to join forces with the men of Judah\'s
tribe so they can conquer the land given to them.

#### The men of Judah (1:4-9, 16-19): 

The men of Judah defeat the Canaanite king, Adoni-bezek, killing 10,000
of his troops. They capture Jerusalem, along with three important
Philistine cities-Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron. They cannot defeat the
enemies who have iron chariots.

#### The man of Judah (Caleb) (1:10-15, 20): 

Caleb leads Judah to capture the cities of Hebron and Debir.

##### The challenge (1:11-15): 

Caleb offers his daughter Acsah as a wife for the one who conquers the
city. Othniel leads the attack and wins Acsah.

##### The conquest (1:10, 20): 

Caleb conquers Hebron, driving out the inhabitants (who are descendants
of the giant Anak).

### Military campaign of Benjamin (1:21): 

Even though Judah previously burned the city of Jerusalem, Benjamin is
not able to drive out the Jebusites who live there.

### Military campaign of Manasseh and Ephraim (1:22-29): 

They defeat some of their enemies but allow them to stay in the land as
slaves.

### Military campaign of Zebulun (1:30): 

They enslave their enemies, whom they are unable to drive out of the
land.

### Military campaign of Asher (1:31-32): 

They are also unable to drive out their enemies.

### Military campaign of Naphtali (1:33): 

They are unable to drive out the enemies living in their land, but they
enslave them.

### Military campaign of Dan (1:34-36): 

The Amorites confine this tribe to the hill country, although the tribes
of Manasseh and Ephraim enslave the Amorites later.

THE CASTIGATION OF ISRAEL (2:1-5): 
----------------------------------

At a place called Bokim, the angel of the Lord sternly rebukes Israel
for making treaties with the people living in Canaan and for failing to
drive them out.

THE CORRUPTION OF ISRAEL (2:6-23) 
---------------------------------

### The root of the matter (2:6-10): 

Israel serves the Lord as long as Joshua lives, but when he dies, they
fail to remember what the Lord has done for them.

### The fruit of the matter (2:11-23): 

Because they fail to remember the Lord\'s deeds, Israel experiences a
series of five-step cycles.

#### Step one: sin (Israel turns from the Lord.) 

#### Step two: servitude (The Lord allows Israel\'s enemies to oppress them.) 

#### Step three: supplication (Israel prays for forgiveness.) 

#### Step four: salvation (The Lord raises up a judge, or deliverer, to rescue them.) 

#### Step five: sin (The cycle begins again.)

The Lord allows some of the pagan peoples to remain in Canaan so the
faith and fighting skills of Israel\'s later generations can be

After delivering the tax money to King Eglon, Ehud requests a private
meeting with the king to tell him a secret message. The king sends his
