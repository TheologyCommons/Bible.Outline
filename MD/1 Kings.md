successor. Adonijah begs for mercy from Solomon, who grants it.

THE COLDNESS OF DAVID (1:1-4):

As David grows old, he becomes unable to keep warm, so his advisers find
a beautiful young woman to keep him warm.

------------------------------------

Adonijah, a half brother of Solomon, attempts to crown himself king in
his father\'s place. He is helped by Joab and Abiathar the priest, and

sacrifice at En-rogel.

become the next king.

celebration among the people of Jerusalem.

THE COMPASSION OF SOLOMON (1:41-53):

the altar of the sacred tent. He asks for mercy from Solomon, who grants
it as long as Adonijah remains loyal to him.

to death!

king, but Solomon does not kill him.

Amasa.

### Shimei (2:36-46)

it into 12 pieces, giving Jeroboam 10 pieces.

###### Ahijah\'s interpretation (11:31-40):

10 of Israel\'s tribes because of Solomon\'s many sins! Jeroboam flees
to Egypt to escape Solomon\'s anger.

threaten the tribes with even harsher rule.

as their king.

##### Jeroboam builds two gold calf idols and places them in Bethel and Dan, two cities of the northern kingdom. 

##### He appoints non-Levites to serve as priests. 

##### He institutes his own religious festival. 

#### Why he does it (12:25-27): 

He does it to keep his people from returning to Jerusalem and
sacrificing in the Temple.

### His altar (13:1-32) 

#### The prophecy (13:1-2): 

As Jeroboam offers a sacrifice on his pagan altar at Bethel, a man of
God foretells that one day a future king will defile this altar by
burning on it the bones of the very priests who are sacrificing upon it!

#### The proof (13:3-5) 

##### The crack in the altar (13:3, 5): 

As proof that the predicted event will happen, the man of God states
that the false altar will split apart, and its ashes will be poured out
on the ground. This happens, just as the man of God foretold.

##### The crippling of the hand (13:4): 

When Jeroboam hears this, he reaches out his hand and orders that the
man be seized, but Jeroboam\'s hand becomes paralyzed!

#### The pleas (13:6-10) 

##### The restoration (13:6): 

At the king\'s urging, the man of God prays to the Lord, who restores
the king\'s hand.

##### The refusal (13:7-10): 

Jeroboam offers to reward the man of God and invites him to the palace;
the man refuses, for God has forbidden him to eat or drink anything in
Bethel.

#### The prophet (13:11-32) 

##### The sin (13:11-19): 

En route back to his home, the man of God is met by an old prophet, who
tells him that an angel wants him to come home with him and share a
meal. The old prophet is lying, but the man of God goes home and eats
with him.

##### The sentence (13:20-22): 

As the man of God eats with the prophet, the Lord sends a message to him
through the prophet. The Lord rebukes him for his disobedience and tells
him that his body will not be buried in the grave of his ancestors.

##### The slaying (13:23-25): 

The man of God eats and then leaves on a donkey, but along the way he is
killed by a lion.

##### The sorrow (13:26-32): 

When the older prophet hears that the man of God has been killed, he
retrieves the body and mourns for him. He instructs his sons to bury him
beside the man of God, for his message is certainly true.

Elijah\'s prayer, sending fire from heaven. Rain falls once again in
Israel, and Elijah flees to Mount Sinai. The Lord tells him to anoint
Elisha as his prophet and Jehu as king. So Elijah finds Elisha and makes

arrange a meeting for him with King Ahab.

##### The contest (18:22-24): 

Elijah proposes a contest between himself and the prophets of Baal.

###### The preparation: Each side is to prepare a young bull as a sacrifice and place it on an altar.

quickly flees to the desert.

might die. But an angel of the Lord comforts and feeds him.

to Mount Sinai, where he spends the night.

#### The confrontation from the Lord (19:9-14): 

After Elijah complains about his situation, the Lord tells him to stand
outside the cave. The Lord passes by, but he is not in the windstorm,
earthquake, or fire. Instead the Lord comes to Elijah in a gentle
whisper, asking him why he is there.

#### The commissioning by the Lord (19:15-17): 

The Lord instructs Elijah to do three things:

=============

Ben-hadad\'s forces besiege Samaria. King Ahab defeats them twice; Ahab
makes a treaty with them but is condemned for sparing Ben-hadad. Jezebel
arranges Naboth\'s death so Ahab can have his vineyard. Elijah condemns
Ahab and Jezebel, but the Lord shows mercy when Ahab is repentant.

AHAB\'S CONQUEST (20:1-43): 
---------------------------

The Lord allows Ahab to defeat the Arameans on two occasions so he will
know that the Lord is God.

### First occasion (20:1-21): 

Ben-hadad and his Aramean forces besiege Samaria and send demands to
King Ahab.

#### Ahab\'s response (20:1-4) 

##### Ben-hadad to Ahab (20:2-3): 

\"Your silver and gold are mine, and so are the best of your wives and
children!\"

##### Ahab to Ben-hadad (20:4): 

\"All that I have is yours!\"

#### Ahab\'s rebellion (20:5-12) 

##### The further demands (20:5-6): 

Ben-hadad then demands that his officials be allowed to search the
palace and take anything valuable.

##### The fury of Ahab (20:7-9): 

Ahab becomes incensed at this last demand and refuses to grant it.

##### The final words (20:10-12): 

Both men exchange hostile messages, and Ben-hadad prepares to destroy
the city.

#### Ahab\'s reassurance (20:13-14): 

A prophet tells Ahab that he will be victorious.

#### Ahab\'s routing (20:15-21): 

Ahab defeats Ben-hadad\'s forces, destroying their horses and chariots
and inflicting heavy losses.

### Second occasion (20:22-43) 

#### The counsel (20:22-28) 

##### The preparation (20:22): 

The prophet tells Ahab to prepare for another attack by Benhadad in the
spring.

##### The presumption (20:23-27): 

Ben-hadad\'s officers falsely presume that the Israelites worship gods
of the hills. They assure Ben-hadad of victory if he attacks the
Israelites on the plains.

##### The prophecy (20:28): 

The prophet reassures Ahab that the Lord will defeat Ben-hadad\'s forces
since they have defamed his name.

#### The conflict (20:29-30): 

Israel utterly routs the Arameans, killing 127,000 of them! Ben-hadad
runs and hides.

#### The conclusion (20:31-43): 

Ben-hadad\'s officers beg for mercy before King Ahab.

##### The agreement (20:31-34): 

Disobeying God\'s command, Ahab makes a treaty with the Arameans and
spares Benhadad.

##### The accusation (20:35-43) 

###### The example (20:35-40):

In order to convey a message to King Ahab, a prophet disguises himself
as a soldier who irresponsibly allowed a prisoner to escape.

###### The explanation (20:40-43): 

King Ahab condemns the prophet, but then the prophet explains that the
same is true of Ahab, since he allowed Ben-hadad to live.

AHAB\'S CONSPIRACY (21:1-16) 
----------------------------

### Ahab\'s request (21:1-2): 

Ahab desires to acquire a vineyard that is near his palace in Jezreel.
Ahab offers to buy it from the owner, Naboth, or to exchange a better
one for it.

### Naboth\'s refusal (21:3-4): 

Naboth declines, since the vineyard has belonged to his family for
generations. Ahab becomes angry and sullen.

### Jezebel\'s reprisal (21:5-16) 

#### Naboth is maligned (21:5-10): 

Jezebel writes letters in Ahab\'s name, instructing the leaders of
Jezreel to arrange for Naboth to be falsely accused of blasphemy and
stoned to death.

#### Naboth is murdered (21:11-16): 

Jezebel\'s plan is carried out. After Naboth is stoned to death, Ahab
claims his vineyard.

AHAB\'S CONDEMNATION (21:17-24): 
--------------------------------

Elijah confronts Ahab in Naboth\'s vineyard and tells him that he and
all his family will eventually be destroyed for their wickedness.

AHAB\'S CONTRITION (21:25-29): 
------------------------------

Hearing Elijah\'s terrible words, the king repents; the Lord chooses to
carry out his sentence only after Ahab\'s death.

1 Kings 22 
==========

King Jehoshaphat of Judah joins forces with King Ahab of Israel to fight
the Arameans. They ignore the warning of Micaiah the prophet and go to
war. Ahab is killed in battle by an arrow. The reigns of Jehoshaphat and
Ahaziah are summarized.

THE END OF AHAB\'S REIGN (22:1-40) 
----------------------------------

### Ahab and Jehoshaphat (22:1-4): 

King Jehoshaphat of Judah agrees to an alliance with Ahab to fight the
Arameans.

### Ahab and the prophets (22:5-28): 

At Jehoshaphat\'s urging, Ahab asks many prophets if he should go to war
against Ramoth-gilead.

#### The prophets of Ahab (22:5-6, 10-12): 

Ahab\'s prophets, about 400 in all, assure him of victory.

#### The prophet of the Lord (22:7-9, 13-28): 

A prophet of the Lord named Micaiah is brought before King Ahab and
asked if Israel will be victorious.

##### What he says (22:13-16): 

At first Micaiah agrees with the other prophets, but Ahab demands that
he tell the truth.

##### What he saw (22:17-23): 

In a vision Micaiah saw the Israelites scattered like sheep because
their shepherd (Ahab) had been killed. He also had a vision of the Lord
allowing a spirit to inspire Ahab\'s prophets to speak lies.

##### What he suggests (22:24-28): 

After Ahab\'s prophets protest, Micaiah advises the king to wait and see
if his prophecies are correct.

### Ahab and the Arameans (22:29-40): 

Both kings decide to lead their armies into battle.

#### The royal apparel (22:29-33): 

King Ahab disguises himself so as not to look like the king, while
Jehoshaphat wears the royal robes. The Arameans see Jehoshaphat and
chase him, but they stop when they realize that he is not King Ahab.

#### The random arrow (22:34-40): 

An enemy arrow, shot at random, strikes King Ahab and mortally wounds
him. Later, the dogs lick his blood just as Elijah and Micaiah had
prophesied.

THE EVENTS OF JEHOSPHAPHAT\'S REIGN (22:41-50): 
-----------------------------------------------

Judah\'s fourth ruler, Jehoshaphat, is ultimately declared good, despite
his mixed record, including allowing pagan shrines to remain, making
peace with Israel, removing all the shrine prostitutes, and building a
fleet of trading ships that are wrecked before they ever set sail.

The Evilness of ahaziah\'s Reign (22:51-53): 
--------------------------------------------

Israel\'s eighth ruler, Ahaziah, is declared wicked because he continues
Jeroboam\'s sin of idolatry in Israel.
