PAUL\'S WARNINGS TO THESE TWO CHURCHES (2:8-23): 
------------------------------------------------

The apostle warns against four dangerous and destructive philosophies.

Gnosticism (2:8-10) 
-------------------

### The fiction (2:8): 

The Gnostics diminish Christ to an angel.

### The facts (2:9-10): 

Paul says Christ was God incarnate in bodily form.

### Legalism (2:11-17) 

#### Paul describes the love of Christ (2:11-15). 

##### We have been crucified and raised to new life with him (2:11-12). 

##### He has forgiven our sins (2:13). 

##### He has blotted out the charges against us (2:14-15). 

#### Paul describes the liberty in Christ (2:16-17): 

Because of this, believers should not criticize each other.

##### In matters of diet (2:16a): 

No one should condemn another believer for what he or she eats or
drinks.

##### In matters of days (2:16b-17): 

No one should condemn another believer for not celebrating certain holy
days, for these old rules were only shadows.

### Mysticism (2:18-19) 

#### The fiction (2:18): 

Mysticism teaches that God can be known through two methods:

##### Through the worship of angels (2:18a) 

##### Through the seeing of visions (2:18b) 

#### The facts (2:19): 

One can only know God through Christ, who is the head of the body, the
church.

### Asceticism (2:20-23) 

#### The fiction (2:21-22): 

Asceticism teaches that one can purify the spirit by punishing the body.

#### The facts (2:20, 23)

##### The believer\'s body and spirit have been crucified with Christ (2:20).
