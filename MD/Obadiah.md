OBADIAH 1
=========

Obadiah receives two visions: the first, about Edom; the second, about
Israel.

THE HOUSE OF EDOM REDUCED BY GOD (1:1-16) 
-----------------------------------------

### Edom\'s contempt (1:3, 10-14) 

#### Their thankless hearts (1:3): 

Dwelling in the high and inaccessible cliffs of their land has made the
Edomites boastful.

#### Their treacherous hand (1:10-14): 

The Edomites, relatives of the Israelites (the nations are descendants
of the twin brothers Jacob and Esau), have sided with Jerusalem\'s
enemies on a number of occasions.

### Edom\'s condemnation (1:1-2, 4-9, 15-16) 

#### The source (1:1-2, 7) 

##### Her foes (1:1-2) 

##### Her friends (1:7) 

#### The severity (1:4-6, 8-9, 15-16) 

##### Her wealth will be removed (1:4-6). 

##### Her wisdom will be reduced (1:8-9). 

##### Her wickedness will be returned (1:15-16): 

Edom will now reap what she has sown.

THE HOUSE OF JACOB RESTORED BY GOD (1:17-21) 
--------------------------------------------

### They will repossess their land (1:17-20). 

### They will rule over their land (1:21).
