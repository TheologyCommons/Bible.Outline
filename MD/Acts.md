ACTS 2 
======

The Holy Spirit comes at Pentecost and fills the believers. Peter, who
once denied the Savior out of fear, now preaches boldly to a huge crowd,
sharing the gospel. Many respond to his message by believing in Christ,
and the new church begins to grow.

THE CLOVEN TONGUES (2:1-4) 
--------------------------

### The sounds at Pentecost (2:1-2): 

Sound like a mighty wind from heaven fills the upper room.

### The sights at Pentecost (2:3): 

Tongues of fire appear and settle on the heads of the believers.

Jews have come from over a dozen foreign countries to attend the Feast
of Pentecost.

### The marvel by this crowd (2:6-11): 

They are amazed to hear their own languages being spoken by the
apostles!

THE CONFUSION (2:12-13) 
-----------------------

### The people in the crowd ask each other, \"What can this mean?\" (2:12). 

### Some of them say, \"They\'re drunk, that\'s all!\" (2:13).

---------------------------

### The speaker (2:14): 

Peter addresses the crowd.

### The statement (2:15): 

\"Some of you are saying these people are drunk. It isn\'t true!\"

### The Scriptures (2:16-21): 

Peter tells the crowd that the prophet Joel foretold all this (see Joel
2:28-32).

#### Joel wrote concerning the Spirit of God (2:16-18): 

The Spirit would be poured out on all people.

Both the Jewish nation and the Roman government are guilty of this
crime.

### The Messiah was resurrected by his Father (2:24-28). 

#### The significance (2:24): 

It is impossible for death to keep Jesus in its grip!

Centuries ago David predicted this (see Ps. 16:8-11).

THE TWOFOLD CONCLUSION (2:29-36) 
--------------------------------

### Concerning Jesus\' resurrection (2:29-32): 

David must have had the Messiah\'s resurrection in mind, for he himself
died and was buried.

### Concerning Jesus\' exaltation (2:33-36): 

Inasmuch as David never ascended into heaven to sit on his throne, he is
referring to Jesus in Psalm 110:1.

THE CONVICTION (2:37): 
----------------------

God\'s Spirit now stirs the people\'s sinful hearts.

THE COMMANDS (2:38-39): 
-----------------------

##### The prophets (3:22-25): 

God spoke through Moses, Samuel, and all the Old Testament prophets in
regard to this plan of the ages.

##### The power (4:8-10): 

Invoking the name of Jesus alone is sufficient.

##### The pardon (4:12): 

His name and his name alone results in redemption.

### Private meeting (4:13-17) 

#### The dismissal (4:13-15): 

The two apostles are sent out of the room for a while so the religious
leaders can confer together.

#### The dilemma (4:16):

##### The identity of the lawyer (5:33-34): 

He is a highly respected Pharisee named Gamaliel.

##### The illustrations by this lawyer (5:35-37): 

He offers examples of two unsuccessful spiritual revolts in past days.

Theudas pretended to be great, and 400 people followed him. After he was
killed, his followers scattered.

###### That of Judas of Galilee (5:37): 

He was killed, and his followers also scattered.

#### The conclusion (5:38-39): 

Gamaliel says, \"Leave these men alone. If they are teaching and doing
these things merely on their own, it will soon be overthrown. But if it
is of God, you will not be able to stop them.\"

#### The consensus (5:40): 

Gamaliel\'s advice is accepted. The apostles are flogged, warned, and
set free.

#### The commitment (5:41-42): 

The apostles rejoice that God has counted them worthy to suffer for
Jesus, and they continue their witness for him!
