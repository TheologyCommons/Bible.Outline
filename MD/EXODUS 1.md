The first part of the book of Exodus sets the scene for God\'s
deliverance of his chosen people, Israel, from slavery in Egypt.

Exodus 1 
========

Israel is being persecuted by an Egyptian pharaoh, probably Thutmose I.

THE REASONS FOR PERSECUTION (Ex. 1:1-10) 
----------------------------------------

### Fruitfulness (Ex. 1:1-7): 

Beginning with 70 individuals, the nation of Israel multiplies so
quickly that they soon fill the land.

### Fear (Ex. 1:8-10): 

Such growth causes Pharaoh great concern, since the Israelites might
join others and attack Egypt.

THE RESULTING PERSECUTION (Ex. 1:11-22) 
---------------------------------------

### Pharaoh\'s building decree (Ex. 1:11-14): 

To lessen the threat from Israel\'s growing strength, Pharaoh enslaves
the Israelites, forcing them to build two storage cities, Pithom and
Rameses. In spite of persecution, Israel continues to multiply.

### Pharaoh\'s bloody decree (Ex. 1:15-22) 

#### His order to the midwives (Ex. 1:15-21): 

In his continuing efforts to curb Israel\'s strength, Pharaoh tells the
Hebrew midwives to kill all Israelite male babies at birth. \"But
because the midwives feared God, they refused to obey the king and
allowed the boys to live.\"

#### His order to the masses (Ex. 1:22): 

Finally, Pharaoh orders his people to throw all Israelite male babies
into the Nile River.
