SECTION OUTLINE ONE (JAMES 1) 
=============================

James opens with a greeting and short discussions on trials and
temptations, trusting, transition, treasure, and true religion.

------------------------

James addresses his book to the twelve Israelite tribes scattered among
the nations.

JAMES SPEAKS OF TRIALS AND TEMPTATIONS (1:2-4, 12-16): 
------------------------------------------------------

Here he pictures these experiences in a twofold light.

### Positive (1:2-4, 12):

To purify and strengthen us.

God will someday give the crown of life to those who successfully
endure.

--------------------------------

### When to trust God (1:5): 

When we need wisdom.

### How to trust God (1:6b-8) 

#### Positive (1:6a):

#### Negative (1:6b-8): 

Wisdom will not be given to a faithless person.

JAMES SPEAKS OF TRANSITION (1:9-11): 
------------------------------------

James touches on the shortness of Iife.

### The example (1:9a, 10a, 11): 

Human glory is like a beautiful flower that blossoms and soon fades
away.

### The exhortation (1:9b, 10b): 

Only God\'s glory is eternal.

JAMES SPEAKS OF TREASURE (1:17-25): 
-----------------------------------

The treasure here is the Bible itself.

### The source of this treasure (1:17): 

It came as a perfect gift from the unchanging God, who \"created all
heaven\'s lights.\"

### The salvation in this treasure (1:18): 

We have become his children through this priceless gift.

### The symbol for this treasure (1:19-25): 

James compares the Bible to a mirror.

JAMES SPEAKS OF TRUE RELIGION (1:26-27) 
---------------------------------------

### The fiction (1:26): 

Some believe they can claim the name of Christ and continue to slander
other Christians.

### The facts (1:27): James lists two (of many) signs indicating true religion. 

#### Having compassion upon orphans and widows (1:27a) 

#### Keeping from the pollution of the world (1:27b) 

SECTION OUTLINE TWO (JAMES 2) 
=============================

James discusses the subjects of godless favouritism and godly faith.

GODLESS FAVORITISM (2:1-13) 
---------------------------

### The command against favouritism (2:1-8) 

#### The examples (2:1-4): 

His readers are guilty of the following sins:

##### Treating rich visitors with great respect (2:1-2a, 3a) 

##### Treating poor visitors with no respect (2:2b, 3b-4) 

#### The enigma (2:5-7): 

James cannot understand this, for often it was the rich who persecuted
them and ridiculed their Saviour.

#### The exhortation (2:8): 

James says, \"Obey our Lord\'s royal command found in the Scriptures.\"

### The consequences of favouritism (2:9-13) 

#### To break this law is to break all laws (2:9-12). 

#### To show no mercy is to receive no mercy (2:13). 

GODLY FAITH (2:14-26): 
----------------------

James contrasts having only head faith with having head, heart, and hand
faith.

### Two examples of having only head faith (2:14-20) 

#### In regard to the destitute (2:14-18): 

Head faith by itself is empty faith and attempts to minister to the poor
by pious words not accompanied by works.

#### In regard to the demons (2:19-20) 

##### The fiction (2:19a): 

\"Do you still think it\'s enough just to believe that there is one
God?\"

##### The facts (2:19b-20): 

\"Well, even the demons believe this, and they tremble in terror!\"

### Two examples of having head, heart, and hand faith (2:21-26) 

#### Abraham (2:21-24): 

He proved his faith by his willingness to offer up his son Isaac.

#### Rahab (2:25-26): 

She proved her faith by protecting the two Israelite spies.

SECTION OUTLINE THREE (JAMES 3) 
===============================

James talks about the tongue.

IMPORTANCE OF THE TONGUE (3:1-2): 
---------------------------------

Anyone who can control his or her tongue is a perfect (totally mature)
person, able to keep the entire body in check.

ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE TONGUE (3:3-5) 
-----------------------------------

### How it can control (3:3-4) 

#### It is as a bridle to a horse (3:3). 

#### It is as a rudder to a ship (3:4). 

### How it can consume (3:5): 

It is like a spark, which, though small, can destroy a great forest.

INIQUITY OF THE TONGUE (3:6): 
-----------------------------

It can be set on fire by hell itself, utterly corrupting and destroying
its owner.

INCORRIGIBILITY OF THE TONGUE (3:7-8) 
-------------------------------------

### People have been able to train the brute creatures (3:7). 

### No person has been able to train the tongue (3:8). 

INCONSISTENCY OF THE TONGUE (3:9-12) 
------------------------------------

### The contradiction (3:9-10): 

It tries to do two things simultaneously.

#### It tries to praise God (3:9a, 10a). 

#### It tries to curse people (3:9b, l0b). 

### The conclusion (3:11-12): 

It cannot do these two things simultaneously.

#### Fresh water and salt water cannot flow from the same spring (3:11, 12c). 

#### A fig tree cannot bear olives (3:12a). 

#### A grapevine cannot produce figs (3:12b). 

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE TONGUE (3:13-18) 
-------------------------------------

### The path it should follow (3:13, 17-18): 

In order to control the tongue, the owner should always allow God\'s
wisdom.

### The path it should flee (3:14-16): 

The owner should never allow his or her tongue to be influenced by
Satan.

SECTION OUTLINE FOUR (JAMES 4) 
==============================

James discusses the pollution of the human heart and the solution to
this problem.

THE POLLUTION IN THE HUMAN HEART (4:1-5, 11-13, 16-17) 
------------------------------------------------------

### The root of the problem (4:1a): 

Envy and wicked desires.

### The fruit of the problem (4:1b-5, 11-13, 16-17) 

#### Constant fighting and quarrelling (4:1) 

#### Killings (4:2a)

#### Boasting about the future (4:13, 16-17) 

THE SOLUTION FOR THE HUMAN HEART (4:6-10, 14-15) 
------------------------------------------------

### Submit to God (4:7a). 

### Resist the Devil (4:7b). 

### Repent (4:8-9). 

### Depend on God for the future (4:14-15). 

#### The wrong action (4:14): 

James reminds his readers that no one knows what tomorrow will bring.

#### The right action (4:15): 

James urges his readers to simply preface their plans by the following
words: \"If the Lord wants us to.\"

SECTION OUTLINE FIVE (JAMES 5)

SUFFERING (5:7-11): 
-------------------

James gives three examples of steadfastness in suffering.

### From the soil (5:7): 

\"Be patient as you wait for the Lord\'s return. Consider the farmers
who eagerly look for the rains in the fall and in the spring.\"

### From the Scriptures (5:10-11): 

\"Job is an example of a man who endured patiently.\"

### From the Second Coming (5:8-9):

#### The power (5:16b): 

A righteous person\'s prayer is both powerful and effective.

#### The person (5:17-18): 

James selects Elijah as his role model here.

##### \"Elijah was as human as we are, and yet when he prayed earnestly that no rain would fall, none fell for the next three and a half years!\" (5:17). 

##### \"Then he prayed for rain, and down it poured\" (5:18). 

SOUL WINNING (5:19-20) 
----------------------

### The faithfulness of a soul winner (5:19) 

### The fruits of a soul winner (5:20): 

The person who turns another from sin has saved that sinner from death.
