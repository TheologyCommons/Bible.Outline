God in one night, and is told how to reward Joshua (Judah\'s high
priest).

JEHOVAH\'S REVELATIONS (1:7-6:8): 
---------------------------------

The eight visions

### First vision-the man among the myrtle trees (1:7-17): 

He is seated upon a red horse, accompanied by other horses and riders.
Two questions are now asked and answered.

#### By the prophet (1:7-11)

### Fourth vision-the cleansing and clothing of Jeshua (Joshua), Judah\'s high priest (3:1 -10)

Foundation Stone.

### Fifth vision-the gold lampstand and the two olive trees (4:1-14) 

#### The gold lampstand (4:1-2, 10) 

##### The information (4:1-2): 

Zechariah sees a gold lampstand holding seven lamps, each supplied with
olive oil from a reservoir at the top.

##### The interpretation (4:10): 

The seven lamps represent God\'s eyes that search all around the earth.

#### The two olive trees (4:3-9, 11-14) 

##### The information (4:3): 

Zechariah sees two olive trees carved upon the lampstand, one on each
side.

##### The interpretation (4:4-9, 11-14): 

The two olive trees represent God\'s two anointed servants who will,
through divine power, complete the Temple building.

### Sixth vision-the flying scroll (5:1-4) 

#### The size (5:1-2): 

Zechariah sees a flying scroll, 30 feet long and 15 feet wide.

#### The symbol (5:3-4): 

This scroll represents God\'s curse upon every home in the land whose
occupants use God\'s name in a false or blasphemous way.

### Seventh vision-the woman in the basket (5:5-11) 

#### The transgressions (5:5-8) 

##### The scope (5:5-6): 

The basket contains the sins of all those living in Judah.

A woman who represents the wickedness of the people sits inside the
basket.

He sees two women with wings like those of a stork.

#### The terminal point (5:10-11): 

The destination is Babylon, where a temple will be built to house the
basket.

### Eighth vision-the four chariots (6:1-8) 

#### What he sees (6:1-3): 

Zechariah sees four chariots coming from between two bronze mountains,
each pulled by a different team of colored horses.

#### What it symbolizes (6:4-8): 

The four heavenly spirits sent from God to do his work on earth.

JESHUA\'S REWARD (6:9-15) 
-------------------------

### What Zechariah is to do (6:9-11): 

Collect the gifts of gold brought to Jerusalem by four Jewish exiles who
arrive from Babylon and make a crown of gold for Jeshua the high priest,
setting it upon his head.

### Why Zechariah is to do it (6:12-15) 

#### By this action the high priest represents the future reign of the Messiah over Israel (6:12-13). 

#### By this action the four exiles represent the future return of the Jews to Israel (6:14-15). 

ZECHARIAH 7-14
==============

Zechariah asks for clarification about God\'s law, predicts conquests in
battle, and addresses the first and second comings of Christ.

THE CLARIFICATION (7:1-14; 8:9-19) 
----------------------------------

### Judah\'s request (7:1-3): 

The people want to know if they should continue their traditional custom
of fasting and mourning during the fifth month as they have done in the
past.

### Jehovah\'s reply (7:4-14; 8:9-19) 

#### He chastens them for what they have done (7:4-7, 11-14). 

##### Their hearts are insincere when they do observe the fifth-month fast (7:4-7). 

##### They are proud and rebellious (7:11-12). 

##### Their sin has led to their dispersion among the nations (7:13-14). 

#### He challenges them to do what they must do now (7:8-10; 8:9-19). 

##### Be honest, merciful, and kind (7:8-9). 

##### Don\'t oppress the helpless (7:10). 

##### Complete the Temple building, and you will be blessed (8:9-15). 

##### Always tell the truth (8:16-18). 

##### Turn the fifth-month fast into a godly celebration (8:19). 

THE CONQUESTS (9:1-8, 11-13): 
-----------------------------

These verses seem to predict the successful warfare of some Gentile
pagans and Jewish patriots.

### The Gentile pagans (9:1-8): 

Here is the record of the conquests of Alexander the Great in 333 B.C.

#### The destruction of Phoenicia, Syria, and Philistia (9:1-7) 

#### The deliverance of Judah (9:8): 

Alexander does not destroy Jerusalem.

### The Jewish patriots (9:11-13): 

This passage probably refers to the victory of the Maccabean Jews over
the Syrians in 165 B.C.
