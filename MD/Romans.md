ROMANS 2
========

Paul describes God\'s dealings with three kinds of people. Each is
charged with high treason against God.

THE MORAL PERSON AND GOD (2:1-11) 
---------------------------------

### The plea rendered (2:1a): 

The moral person says, \"I should be acquitted on grounds that I am not
as bad as some pagans are.\"

### The plea refuted (2:1b-11) 

#### The reason for this (2:1b-4): 

God says, \"You do the same basic things, only in a more refined way!\"

THE PAGAN PERSON AND GOD (2:12-16) 
----------------------------------

### The plea rendered (2:12-13): 

The pagan person says, \"I should be acquitted on the grounds of
ignorance!\"

### The plea refuted (2:14-16): 

God says, \"You have the twin witnesses of conscience and nature (see

written law.\"

THE RELIGIOUS PERSON AND GOD (2:17-29) 
--------------------------------------

### The plea rendered (2:17-20): 

The religious man says, \"I should be acquitted on the grounds that I
know the law of God and teach courses in religion!\"

Because of their hypocrisy, they dishonor God\'s holy name among the
Gentiles.

#### The marks of redeemed Jews (2:25-29): 

Their hearts are right with God.

ROMANS 3
========

Paul presents six questions and answers them for his readers.

FIRST QUESTION AND ANSWER (3:1-2) 
---------------------------------

### Question (3:1): 

What are the advantages of being a Jew or of being circumcised?

### Answer (3:2): 

The most important advantage is that Israel has been entrusted with the
Word of God.

SECOND QUESTION AND ANSWER (3:3-4) 
----------------------------------

### Question (3:3): 

Will Israel\'s unfaithfulness nullify God\'s promises?

### Answer (3:4) 

#### Paul\'s testimony (3:4a): 

\"Of course not! Though everyone else in the world is a liar, God is
true.\"

#### David\'s testimony (3:4b): 

Paul quotes from Psalm 51:4 to prove his point.

THIRD QUESTION AND ANSWER (3:5-8) 
---------------------------------

### Question (3:5): 

If our unrighteousness brings out God\'s righteousness, isn\'t he unfair
to punish us?

### Answer (3:6-8) 

#### The reprobation (3:8b): 

Paul has been falsely accused of teaching this very thing-that is, do
evil that good may result.

#### The reply (3:6-8a): 

Paul responds, \"If you follow that kind of thinking \... you might as
well say that the more we sin the better it is! Those who say such
things deserve to be condemned.\"

FOURTH QUESTION AND ANSWER (3:9-20) 
-----------------------------------

### Question (3:9a): 

Are the Jews better than all other people?

### Answer (3:9b-20) 

#### The corruption (3:10-18): 

Paul describes the cancer of sin that has infected the human race.

##### Human conscience is depraved (3:10-11): 

No one even desires to know and follow God.

##### Human character is depraved (3:12): 

All have left the path of good and have become worthless.

##### Human conversation is depraved (3:13-14): 

People\'s talk is foul and filthy, resembling:

###### The stench from an open grave (3:13a) 

###### The poison from a deadly snake (3:13b-14) 

##### Human conduct is depraved (3:15-18). 

###### \"They are quick to commit murder\" (3:15-17). 

###### \"They have no fear of God\" (3:18). 

#### The conclusion (3:9, 19-20): 

After presenting all the terrible facts, Paul reaches this twofold
conclusion:

-----------------------------------

### Question (3:21a): 

How then does God save people?

### Answer (3:21b-30)

glory.

#### The Old Testament witness to salvation (3:21b): 

The Scriptures promise salvation apart from the law.

#### The method of salvation (3:22, 24-25, 27-28)

To the contrary, faith fulfils the law!

ROMANS 4
========

Paul employs two of the most famous Old Testament men to illustrate the
doctrine of justification by faith.

THE ILLUSTRATION FROM THE LIFE OF ABRAHAM, ISRAEL\'S RACIAL FATHER (4:1-5, 9-25) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Abraham and his salvation (4:1-5, 9-15) 

#### What Abraham received (4:1-5): 

God himself cancelled Abraham\'s sins and declared him righteous.

#### How Abraham received it (4:1-5) 

##### It did not come about by his works (4:1-2, 4). 

##### It did come about by his faith (4:3, 5). 

#### When Abraham received it (4:9-15) 

##### He received it before he was circumcised (4:9-12). 

##### He received it before the giving of the law (4:13-15). 

### Abraham and his seed (4:16-25): 

Paul shows the results of Abraham\'s faith following his salvation.

#### Abraham\'s physical seed (4:18-22) 

##### The promise (4:18): 

God told Abraham he would bear a son through Sarah.

##### The problem (4:19): 

Abraham and his barren wife were too old for this.

##### The perseverance (4:20-22): 

Abraham continued to believe God for the impossible, and Isaac was born!

#### Abraham\'s spiritual seed (4:16-17, 23-25): 

All Jews and Gentiles who exercise the kind of faith Abraham had are,
spiritually speaking, related to Abraham, who is called the \"father of
all who believe.\"

THE ILLUSTRATION FROM THE LIFE OF DAVID, ISRAEL\'S ROYAL FATHER (4:6-8) 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### The transgressions of David (4:6): 

He was guilty of adultery and murder (see 2 Sam. 11:1-24).

### The testimony of David (4:7-8): 

The repentant king was forgiven, cleansed, and justified by faith.

ROMANS 5
========

Paul talks about the joy that comes from faith. He contrasts the sinful
Adam with the sinless Christ.

A SUMMARY OF JUSTIFICATION (5:1-11): 
------------------------------------

Paul lists five results of divine justification.

### The believer has peace with God (5:1): 

This is accomplished through the work done by Jesus Christ.

### The believer has access to God (5:2): 

This high privilege brings about great confidence and joy concerning the
future.

### The believer has assurance from God (5:3-4). 

#### The fact of this assurance (5:3): 

It helps us in time of suffering.

#### The fruit of the assurance (5:4): 

Suffering produces perseverance, which produces character, which
produces hope.

### The believer is indwelt by God (5:5): 

The Holy Spirit lives in the hearts of believers.

### The believer is preserved in God (5:6-11): 

A believer\'s salvation is secure, guaranteed by:

#### Christ\'s past work on Calvary\'s cross (5:6-8) 

##### What he did (5:6): 

He died on the cross for us.

##### Why he did it (5:7-8a): 

He died because he loves us.

##### When he did it (5:8b): 

He did it when we were still helpless and hostile sinners.

#### Christ\'s present work at God\'s right hand (5:9-11): 

Paul says Christ died to save us and now lives to keep us saved.

A SUMMARY OF CONDEMNATION (5:12-21): 
------------------------------------

Paul contrasts the work of Adam (the sinful father of all people) with
the work of Christ (the sinless Saviour of all people).

### The work of Adam (5:12-15, 16a, 17a, 18a, 19a, 20a, 21a) 

#### The reality of his act (5:12a): 

\"When Adam sinned, sin entered the entire human race.\"

#### The scope of his act (5:12b-13): 

\"So death spread to everyone, for everyone sinned.\"

#### The nature of his act (5:19a): 

\"Because one-person disobeyed God, many people became sinners.\"

#### The results of his act (5:14-15a, 16a, 17a, 18a, 21a) 

##### Imputed judgment on Adam\'s posterity (5:14): 

\"They all died anyway-even though they did not disobey an explicit
commandment of God, as Adam did.\"

##### Eternal judgment on all unsaved (5:15a, 16a, 17a, 18a, 21a): 

Adam\'s sin brought death and condemnation upon all people.

#### The relationship of the law to his act (5:20a): 

\"God\'s law was given so that all people could see how sinful they
were.\"

### The work of Christ (5:15b, 16b, 17b, 18b, 19b, 20b, 21b): 

Because of Christ\'s death, people can be saved in spite of their sin.

#### The scope of his act (5:15b, 18b) 

##### \"Jesus Christ \... brought forgiveness to many through God\'s bountiful gift\" (5:15b). 

##### \"Christ\'s one act of righteousness makes all people right in God\'s sight and gives them life\" (5:18b). 

#### The nature of his act (5:19b): 

\"Because one other person obeyed God, many people will be made right in
God\'s sight.\"

#### The results of his act (5:16b, 17b, 21b) 

##### Justification (5:16b): 

All people can now be accepted by God.

##### Sanctification (5:17b): 

All people can now be made righteous in God\'s eyes.

##### Glorification (5:21b): 

All people can now have eternal life.

#### The relationship of sin to his act (5:20b): \"As people sinned more and more, God\'s wonderful kindness became more abundant.\" 

ROMANS 6
========

Paul introduces God\'s threefold method leading to sanctification.

STEP 1-KNOW (6:1-10): Believers must be aware of three facts. 
-------------------------------------------------------------

### They have been crucified with Christ (6:1-3). 

### They have been resurrected with Christ (6:4-5). 

### They are now both dead and alive (6:6-10). 

#### Dead to their sin (6:6-7): 

We should no longer be slaves to sin, for we have been crucified with
Christ.

#### Alive in the Saviour (6:8-10): 

We are now to live in the resurrection power of the one who rose from
the dead and is forever alive.

STEP 2-RECKON (6:11): 
---------------------

We are to count our crucifixion and resurrection as accomplished events.

STEP 3-YIELD (6:12-23): 
-----------------------

Paul describes two kinds of yielding.

### The wrong kind (6:12-13a): 

We are not to yield the members of our body as tools of wickedness.

### The right kind (6:13b-23) 

#### The confusion (6:15a): 

\"Since God\'s grace has set us free from the law, does this mean we can
go on sinning?\"

#### The correction (6:15b-18): 

\"Of course not! Don\'t you realize that whatever you choose to obey
becomes your master? You can choose sin, which leads to death, or you
can choose to obey God and receive his approval.\"

#### The challenge (6:13b-14, 19-22): 

We are to yield the members of our body as tools of righteousness.

#### The conclusion (6:23) 

##### \"The wages of sin is death\" (6:23a). 

##### \"The free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord\" (6:23b). 

ROMANS 7 
========

Paul discusses how the law of God applies to and affects three kinds of
people.

SPIRITUAL PEOPLE AND THE LAW (7:1-6) 
------------------------------------

### Their relationship to the law (7:1-3, 5) 

#### They are like widows freed from their husbands (7:1-3). 

#### They are like dead men freed from their lusts (7:5). 

### Their relationship to the Saviour (7:4, 6) 

#### They have been raised by Christ (7:4a, 6): 

They are released from the law.

#### They are now to produce fruit through Christ (7:4b): 

Thus spiritual people are delivered from the law.

NATURAL PEOPLE AND THE LAW (7:7-13): 
------------------------------------

The law is used in a twofold manner.

### The illustration usage (7:7, 10): 

God used the law to reveal the sinfulness of the flesh.

### The condemnation usage (7:8-9, 11-13): 

Sin used the law to rekindle the sinfulness of the flesh. Thus, natural
people are doomed by the law.

CARNAL PEOPLE AND THE LAW (7:14-26) 
-----------------------------------

### Paul has learned that any attempt to keep the law leads to carnality (7:14-23). 

#### The confusion (7:14-16): 

Paul\'s frustration is twofold.

##### He doesn\'t do the things he wants to do (7:14-15a, 16a). 

##### He does the things he doesn\'t want to do (7:15b, 16b). 

#### The corruption (7:17-20): 

He realizes the total corruption of his old sinful nature.

#### The conclusion (7:21-23): 

He understands the daily struggle within him.

##### The old nature, always attempting to do wrong (7:21a, 23) 

##### The new nature, always attempting to do right (7:21b-22) 

### Paul has learned that no attempt to keep the law can lead to spirituality (7:24-25). 

#### The agony of Paul\'s problem (7:24): 

\"What a miserable person I am! Who will free me from this life that is
dominated by sin?\"

#### The answer to Paul\'s problem (7:25): 

\"Thank God! The answer is in Jesus Christ our Lord.\"

ROMANS 8
========

Paul outlines seven new assurances accompanying salvation.

THE BELIEVER HAS A NEW POSITION (8:1-8). 
----------------------------------------

### Our position in regard to the Son of God (8:1-3): 

The believer is in Christ.

#### The miracle involved (8:1, 3a): 

Believers receive no condemnation and are freed from sin and death.

#### The means involved (8:2, 3b): 

This was accomplished not through the Law of Moses but by the death of
Christ.

### Our position in regard to the law of God (8:4-8): 

We are now able to fulfil the righteous requirements of the law in and
through Christ.

THE BELIEVER HAS A NEW GUEST (8:9-14). 
--------------------------------------

### Who he is (8:9): 

He is the blessed Holy Spirit himself.

### What he does (8:10-14) 

#### He once strengthened Christ and raised him from the dead (8:11).

#### He now strengthens us and will someday raise us from the dead (8:10, 12-14). 

THE BELIEVER HAS A NEW ADOPTION (8:15-17): 
------------------------------------------

We are now members of God\'s family.

### Giving us an intimacy with the Father (8:15-16) 

### Giving us an inheritance from the Father (8:17) 

THE BELIEVER HAS A NEW HOPE (8:18-25): 
--------------------------------------

The nature of this hope is the full and final redemption of all things,
including:

### Christians (8:18, 23-25) 

#### The present grief (8:18a, 23): 

Believers groan to be released from pain and suffering.

#### The future glory (8:18b, 24-25) 

##### The comparison (8:18b): 

Today\'s grief is nothing when compared with tomorrow\'s glory.

##### The command (8:24-25): 

Until then, however, we are to wait patiently and confidently.

### Creation (8:19-22) 

#### Nature, the victim (8:20, 21b-22): 

The natural world of plants and animals groans in pain because of the
fall.

#### Nature, the victor (8:19, 21a): 

Nature, too, will be liberated from decay and death to freedom and
fruitfulness.

THE BELIEVER HAS A NEW PRAYER HELPER (8:26-27). 
-----------------------------------------------

### The identity of this helper (8:26a): 

He is the Holy Spirit.

### The indispensability of this helper (8:26b): 

His prayers are vital, because we don\'t even know what we should pray
for.

### The intensity of this helper (8:26c-27) 

#### How he prays (8:26c): 

He prays for us with groanings that cannot be expressed in words.

#### What he prays (8:27): 

He pleads for us in harmony with God\'s own will.

THE BELIEVER HAS A NEW CONFIDENCE (8:28). 
-----------------------------------------

### What it involves (8:28a): God causes everything to work together for good. 

### Whom it involves (8:28b): 

Those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them.

THE BELIEVER HAS A NEW DESTINY (8:29-39). 
-----------------------------------------

### The summary (8:29): 

The Father himself has decreed that all believers should become like his
dear Son!

### The steps (8:30) 

#### We were foreknown by the Father (8:30a). 

#### We were predestined by the Father (8:30b). 

#### We were called by the Father (8:30c). 

#### We were justified by the Father (8:30d). 

#### We were glorified by the Father (8:30e). 

### The security (8:31-39) 

#### There exists no possible accusation against believers (8:31-34). 

##### The Father will not allow this (8:31-33). 

###### He once gave us his Son (8:31-32a). 

###### He now gives us all things (8:32b-33). 

##### The Son will not allow this (8:34). 

###### He died for us (8:34a). 

###### He was resurrected for us (8:34b). 

###### He now prays for us (8:34c). 

#### There exists no possible separation from the Saviour (8:35-39): 

This includes:

##### Both life and death (8:35-38a) 

##### Both angels and demons (8:38b) 

##### Both present and future (8:38c) 

##### Both height and depth (8:39) 

ROMANS 9
========

In the next three chapters, Paul overviews God\'s threefold dealings
with Israel. Here, he overviews the sovereignty of God and Israel\'s
selection in the past.

THE NINE SPIRITUAL ADVANTAGES OF THIS SOVEREIGN SELECTION (9:1-5) 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Paul\'s grief over Israel (9:1-3): 

The apostle is so burdened over Israel\'s unbelief that he is willing to
suffer eternal damnation if that would help them come to Christ.

### God\'s gifts to Israel (9:4-5) 

#### They are a special nation (9:4a). 

#### They have been adopted by God (9:4b, 5). 

#### They have had God\'s glory revealed to them (9:4c). 

#### They have been given the covenants (9:4d). 

#### They have been given the law (9:4e). 

#### They have the privilege of worshiping him (9:4f). 

#### They have the messianic promises (9:4g). 

#### They have a godly ancestry (9:5a). 

#### They are the people from which Christ came (9:5b). 

THE FIVE PERSONAL EXAMPLES OF THIS SOVEREIGN SELECTION (9:6-29) 
---------------------------------------------------------------

### The example of Ishmael and Isaac (9:6-10): 

God chose Isaac (Abraham\'s son through Sarah) over Ishmael (Abraham\'s
son through Hagar).

### The example of Esau and Jacob (9:11-13) 

#### What God did (9:12b-13): 

He chose Jacob (the second-born twin son of Isaac) over Esau (the
firstborn twin).

#### When God did it (9:11a, 12a): 

He made this choice long before they were even born.

#### Why God did it (9:11b): 

He did it to show that his sovereign decrees are not based on what
yet-unborn human beings might or might not do.

### The example of Pharaoh (9:14-24) 

#### The facts involved (9:15-18) 

##### God determined to pardon sinful Israel with undeserved grace (9:15-16). 

##### God determined to punish sinful Pharaoh with deserved judgment (9:17-18). 

#### The fairness involved (9:14, 19-24) 

##### In light of this, is God righteous? Yes! (9:14, 21-24). 

###### As a potter creates vessels, God creates nations (9:14, 21-22). 

###### As a potter controls those vessels, God controls nations (9:23-24). 

##### In light of this, is man responsible? Yes! (9:19-20): 

As the vessels have no right to criticize the potter, the nations have
no right to criticize the Lord.

### The example from Hosea (9:25-26): 

This Old Testament prophet predicted that God would not limit his grace
to Israel but would save repenting Gentile peoples; Hosea called these
Gentiles \"children of the living God\" (Hos. 2:23; 1:10).

### The example from Isaiah (9:27-29): 

Paul quotes from Isaiah to demonstrate God\'s sovereignty concerning
Israel.

#### Out of the millions of Israelites, only a small remnant will be saved (Isa. 10:22-23) (9:27-28). 

#### Even the remnant would perish apart from the grace of God (Isa. 1:9) (9:29). 

THE TWO GRAND CONCLUSIONS CONCERNING THIS SOVEREIGN SELECTION (9:30-33) 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Through faith the Gentiles have found righteousness without even seeking it (9:30). 

### Through the law Israel has not found righteousness even after seeking it (9:31-33). 

#### The seeking (9:31-32): 

They tried to be saved by works.

#### The stumbling (9:33): 

They have stumbled over Christ the rock, as predicted by Isaiah (Isa.
8:14; 28:16).

ROMANS 10
=========

Paul overviews God\'s righteousness and Israel\'s present rejection.

THE PRAYER CONCERNING GOD\'S RIGHTEOUSNESS (10:1-3) 
---------------------------------------------------

### The prayer (10:1): 

Paul prays for Israel\'s salvation.

### The problem (10:2-3): 

Israel possesses:

#### Zeal without knowledge (10:2-3a) 

#### Works without faith (10:3b) 

THE SOURCE OF GOD\'S RIGHTEOUSNESS (10:4-5) 
-------------------------------------------

### It is found in Christ (10:4). 

### It was foretold by Moses (Lev. 18:5) (10:5). 

THE AVAILABILITY OF GOD\'S RIGHTEOUSNESS (10:6-8) 
-------------------------------------------------

### Negative (10:6-7): 

One need not search the heavens or descend into the deep to find it.

### Positive (10:8): 

It is, through Christ, as near as one\'s mouth and heart! Moses
predicted this in Deuteronomy 30:12-14.

THE RECEPTION OF GOD\'S RIGHTEOUSNESS (10:9-10): 
------------------------------------------------

Both one\'s heart and mouth are involved.

### It is conceived in the heart (10:9b-10a). 

### It is confirmed by the mouth (10:9a, 10b). 

THE SCOPE OF GOD\'S RIGHTEOUSNESS (10:11-13) 
--------------------------------------------

### It is impartial (10:11-12): 

It does not distinguish between Jews and Gentiles.

### It is universal (10:13): 

Anyone calling on the name of the Lord will be saved.

THE PRESENTATION OF GOD\'S RIGHTEOUSNESS (10:14-15): 
----------------------------------------------------

Paul presents a compelling case for faithful witnessing.

### sinner must call on the Lord to be saved (10:14a). 

### A sinner must believe in order to call (10:14b). 

### A sinner must hear in order to believe (10:14c-15):

who bring good news\" (Isa. 52:7).

ROMANS 11
=========

Paul overviews the wisdom of God and Israel\'s future restoration.

THIS FUTURE RESTORATION IS ASSURED BECAUSE ISRAEL\'S PRESENT REJECTION IS NOT TOTAL (11:1-10, 11b-24). 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The factions of Israel (11:1-10): 

Paul divides Israel into two groups.

#### The minority group (11:1-6) 

##### As represented by Paul in the New Testament (11:1): 

His own conversion shows that God has not rejected all Israelites.

##### As represented by Elijah in the Old Testament (11:2-6): 

This powerful prophet, along with 7,000 other Israelites, did not bow to
Baal (see also 1 Kings 19:18).

#### The majority group (11:7-10): 

Three Old Testament men predicted that God would harden the hearts of
unbelieving Israel.

##### Moses (Deut. 29:4) (11:7-8a) 

##### David (Ps. 69:22-23) (11:9-10) 

##### Isaiah (Isa. 29:10) (11:8b) 

### The fullness of the Gentiles (11:11b-25): 

This phrase refers to a specific period of time.

#### The definition of this period (11:25): It is the time span involved in the completion of the body of Christ, consisting of both Jews and Gentiles, beginning at Pentecost and ending at the Rapture. 

#### The details concerning this period (11:11b-24) 

##### The purpose (11:11b-12): 

One purpose is to make Israel jealous to be in God\'s favor again.

##### The preacher (11:13-15): 

Paul has been appointed by God himself to help make this a reality.

##### The parable (11:16-24): 

Paul employs an olive tree to illustrate all this.

###### The roots of the tree are made up of Abraham and other godly Old Testament men (11:16). 

###### Some of the original branches have been broken off, referring to unbelieving Jews (11:1 7a). 

###### Now some branches from a wild olive tree have been grafted in, referring to believing Gentiles (11:17b-23). 

###### The once-removed original branches will someday be grafted back in, referring to the future repentant Israel (11:24). 

THIS FUTURE RESTORATION IS ASSURED BECAUSE ISRAEL\'S PRESENT REJECTION IS NOT FINAL (11:11a, 26-36). 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The Israel of God (11:11a, 26-32) 

#### The foretelling (11:11a, 26-27) 

##### Israel restored through the promised Christ (11:26): 

Isaiah predicted that the Deliverer would accomplish this (Isa. 59:20).

##### Israel restored through the promised covenant (11:27): 

Isaiah predicted that God would keep his covenant with Israel (Isa.
59:21).

All the above will come to pass, for God\'s gifts and calling are
irrevocable.

Paul praises God by uttering one of Scripture\'s greatest doxologies.
