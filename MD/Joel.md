JOEL 1-3
--------

Joel writes about current and future conditions in Israel.

### CURRENT CONDITIONS (1:1-20): 

The worst locust plague in Judah\'s history has settled upon the land.

#### The devastation (1:1-12, 15-18) 

##### The severity (1:1-4, 6-7, 15): 

The crops are consumed by a fourfold attack:

###### The cutting locusts (1:1-4a, 15) 

###### The swarming locusts (1:4b) 

###### The hopping locusts (1:4c) 

###### The stripping locusts (1:4d, 6-7) 

##### The sorrow (1:5, 8-12, 16-18): 

Hungry cries of anguish are heard everywhere.

#### The proclamation (1:13-14) 

##### Dress in sackcloth (1:13a). 

##### Declare a fast (1:13b-14a). 

##### Gather in the Temple (1:14b). 

#### The supplication (1:19-20): 

Both people and animals cry out for divine intervention.

### COMING CONDITIONS (2:1-3:21): 

There will be three future \"days.\"

#### The day of Pentecost (2:28-32; see also Acts 2:14-18; Rev. 6:12-14) 

##### The contents (2:28-32) 

###### God\'s Spirit will be poured out upon Israel (2:28-29). 

###### Great signs will occur in the heavens (2:30-31). 

###### Salvation will be offered to all (2:32). 

##### The chronology (see Acts 2:14-18; Rev. 6:12-14) 

###### Present fulfilment (see Acts 2:14-18) 

###### Future fulfilment (see Rev. 6:12-14) 

#### The day of the Lord\-\--a title for the coming Great Tribulation (2:1-21; 3:1-16): 

Using the locust plague as an object lesson, Joel describes a future
invasion where enemy soldiers (not insects) will ravage the land.

##### The alarm (2:1, 15) 

##### The admonition (2:12-14, 16-17): 

God calls for Israel\'s repentance.

##### The assurance (2:18-21): 

God promises deliverance following this repentance.

##### The attack (2:2-11): 

A fierce and seemingly unstoppable foreign army will invade Israel,
marching in precise fashion, causing great fear.

##### The anger (3:3-8): 

God is furious concerning Israel\'s past and future mistreatment by the
pagan Gentiles.

##### The announcement (3:9-11): 

These pagan Gentiles are warned to prepare for the worst, for God
himself will soon battle against them.

##### The assembling (3:1-2, 12): 

God plans to drive his enemies into the valley of Jehoshaphat (called
the Kidron Valley in the New Testament) so he can kill them.

##### The annihilation (3:13-16): 

The enemies will be crushed like overripe grapes.

#### The day of Christ-a title for the Millennium (2:22-27; 3:17-21) 

##### Body blessings-the provision of food (2:22-26; 3:18-19) 

##### Soul blessings-the presence of God (2:27; 3:17, 20-21)
