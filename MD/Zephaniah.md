ZEPHANIAH 1-3 
=============

Zephaniah describes three special \"days,\" two of which are grievous,
while the third is glorious.

THE GRIEVOUS DAYS (1:1-3:8): 
----------------------------

Zephaniah pronounces judgment.

### The first grievous day (1:1-13; 2:1-15; 3:1-5): 

Historical in scope, it includes Judah and her surrounding neighbours
and is fulfilled by the king of Babylon.

#### Judah (1:1-13; 2:1-3; 3:1-5) 

##### Zephaniah\'s condemnation (1:1-13; 3:1-5) 

###### Her sins (1:4-6, 8-9, 11-12; 3:1-5) 

####### Idolatry (1:4-6) 

####### Greed (1:11) 

####### Utter indifference to God (1:12; 3:2) 

####### Rebellion, violence, and crime (3:1) 

####### Leaders who follow pagan customs (1:8-9) 

####### Judges who are like ravenous wolves that leave no trace of their prey (3:3) (g) 

Godless prophets and priests (3:4-5)

###### Her sentence (1:1-3, 7, 10, 13) 

####### Cries of anguish will be heard throughout the land (1:10). 

####### The land will be reduced to rubble (1:1-3, 7). 

####### The people\'s wealth will be plundered and their homes demolished (1:13). 

##### Zephaniah\'s invitation (2:1-3): 

He tells Judah to repent and escape God\'s wrath.

#### The Gentiles (2:4-15)

Israel\'s eastern enemies

Israel\'s southern enemy

##### Assyria and its capital, Nineveh (2:13-15): 

Israel\'s northern enemy

### The second grievous day (1:14-18; 3:6-8): 

Prophetic in scope, it will include all nations and is yet to be
fulfilled by the King of heaven.

#### The designation (1:14): 

Zephaniah calls it the \"day of the LORD,\" a probable reference to the
coming Great Tribulation.

#### The devastation (1:15-18; 3:6-8) 

##### Earth\'s citizens will stumble as blind men (1:15-17a). 

##### Their blood will be poured out into the dust (1:17b).

THE GLORIOUS DAY (3:9-20): 
--------------------------

Zephaniah proclaims justice.

### To the Gentiles (3:9): 

Their many languages will be unified and purified, thus allowing all
people to worship God together.

### To the Jews (3:10-20) 

#### Their regathering (3:10, 19-20a) 

#### Their restoring (3:20b) 

#### Their refining (3:11-13) 

#### Their rejoicing (3:14-18): 

God himself will join in their happy song.
