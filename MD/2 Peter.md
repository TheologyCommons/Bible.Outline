Peter has written both his epistles admonishing his readers to remember
the great truths.

### The derision (3:3-5a): 

Peter warns that scoffers will appear during the last days.

#### They will falsify the facts concerning the future fire judgment (3:3-4): 

They will say, \"Jesus promised to come back, did he? Then where is
he?\"

#### They will deliberately forget the facts concerning the past flood judgment (3:5a).

In light of all this, two biblical writers admonish believers to live
godly and holy lives.

saved.
