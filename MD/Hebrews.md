Spirit and have tasted of God\'s Word.

##### The what (6:6a): 

After experiencing this, they turn from God.

These people cannot be brought back to repentance, for they crucify the
Son of God all over again.

##### When the land is fruitless, it is cursed (6:8).

Hebrews 7 
=========

The author identifies and equates the priesthood of Jesus with that of
Melchizedek.

A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE (7:1-3) 
--------------------------------

### The person of Melchizedek (7:1a, 2b-3) 

#### Who he was (7:2b): 

His name means \"king of justice,\" and he was also the \"king of
peace.\"

#### What he did (7:1a):

There is no record of either his birth or his death.

#### The battle (7:2a): 

Following the defeat of his enemies, Abraham met Melchizedek and paid
tithes to him.

#### The blessing (7:1b): 

Melchizedek blessed Abraham.

A THEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE (7:4-28): 
-----------------------------------

The author lists the various characteristics of Jesus, who, according to
the Father\'s decree, is to be a priest after the order of Melchizedek
(see Ps. 110:4).

Thus, his priesthood would be:

### Royal (as was that of Melchizedek) (see 7:1) 

### Superior (7:4-10) 

#### To whom? (7:5-7): To Levi, founder of the Levitical priesthood. 

#### Why? (7:4, 8-10) 

##### Abraham was the ancestor of Levi (7:9). 

##### The yet unborn Levi thus tithed to Melchizedek while still in the loins of Abraham (7:4, 8, 10). 

### Independent (7:11-15) 

#### Independent of the law (7:11-12). 

#### Independent of the tribe of Levi (7:13-15): 

Christ came from the tribe of Judah.

### Everlasting (7:16-17) 

### Guaranteed (7:20-22): 

The Father himself took an oath concerning this.

### Continuous (7:23) 

### Permanent (7:24) 

### Holy (7:26) 

### All-sufficient (7:18-19, 25, 27) 

### Flawless (7:28)

It is located in the heavenly sanctuary.

### The priest is better (8:2):

----------------------------------

### The Levitical priests offered up animals in the earthly sanctuary (8:4). 

### The Lamb of God offers up himself in the heavenly sanctuary (8:3). 

ITS SECURITY IS SUPERIOR (8:5-13). 
----------------------------------

### The old agreement was mediated by Moses (8:5, 7-8a). 

#### It was ruined by Israel\'s sin (8:7-8a). 

#### It was written on dead stones (see Ex. 32:15). 

### The new agreement is mediated by Christ (8:6, 8b-13). 

#### It is restored by Jesus\' sacrifice (8:6, 8b-9). 

#### It is written on living hearts (8:10-13).

THE RATIFICATION OF EACH SANCTUARY (9:16-28): 
---------------------------------------------

Both sanctuaries had to be purified and ratified by the blood of a
sacrifice.

### The earthly sanctuary (9:16-22) 

#### The sprinkler of this blood (9:16-19a): 

Moses.

#### The source of this blood (9:19b): 

An animal.

#### The failure of these sacrifices (10:4, 11 b): 

They could never take away sin.

### The superiority of the heavenly Lamb (10:5-10, 12-18) 

#### The purpose (10:5-10):

#### The permanence (10:12, 14): 

His offering was once for all time, never to be repeated.

#### The patience (10:13): 

\"He waits until his enemies are humbled as a footstool under his
feet.\"

Someday he will purify the hearts of unbelieving Israel.

The Challenge (10:19-39):

former period of suffering.
