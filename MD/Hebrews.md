Melchizedek.

A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE (7:1-3) 
--------------------------------

### The person of Melchizedek (7:1a, 2b-3)

-----------------------------------

The author lists the various characteristics of Jesus, who, according to
the Father\'s decree, is to be a priest after the order of Melchizedek
(see Ps. 110:4).

Thus, his priesthood would be:

### Royal (as was that of Melchizedek) (see 7:1)

#### To whom? (7:5-7): To Levi, founder of the Levitical priesthood. 

#### Why? (7:4, 8-10)

### The old agreement was mediated by Moses (8:5, 7-8a).

sacrifice.

### The earthly sanctuary (9:16-22) 

#### The sprinkler of this blood (9:16-19a): 

Moses.

#### The source of this blood (9:19b):
