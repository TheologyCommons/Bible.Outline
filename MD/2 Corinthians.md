in the face of suffering and an explanation of his recent experiences.

CONSOLATION (1:1-7) 
-------------------

Paul describes the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ as \"the source of
every mercy and the God who comforts us.\"

### The purpose of consolation and comfort (1:4-5) 

#### The root (1:5): 

The more we suffer, the more God comforts us.

#### The fruit (1:4):

Jesus is always truthful.

Paul writes about forgiveness and about the effect the gospel is having
on those he witnesses to.

Corinthians.

He wrote hoping the church would get some matters straightened out
before he visited them.

### The pain behind this letter (2:4): 

He penned it in great distress and anguish.

THE TRANSGRESSOR (2:5-11)

### The individual (2:5-6):

The man repented, and Paul commands the church to restore him, lest
Satan take advantage of their unforgiving spirit.

THE TRIUMPH (2:12-17) 
---------------------

### Paul\'s concern (2:12-13): 

He experiences some initial unrest when he does not find Titus in Troas.

Whatever his lot, Paul has the assurance of ultimate victory.

### The fragrance of the gospel message (2:14-16)

THE UNWRITTEN GRACE OF GOD (3:1-6) 
----------------------------------

### The Pharisees\' written letters of recommendation (3:1): 

Boastful Jewish leaders carry about with them long letters of
recommendation.

### The apostle\'s living letters of recommendation (3:2-6): 

Paul has no such need for dead and formal letters, as the transformed
lives of his converts literally shout about his effectiveness and God\'s
grace.

THE UNVEILED GLORY OF GOD (3:7-18): 
-----------------------------------

Paul contrasts the Law of Moses with the gospel of grace, showing the
superiority of the latter over the former.

### The law of Moses (3:7, 9a, 10a, 11a, 13-15) 

#### It was accompanied by a fading glory (3:7, 10a). 

#### It was temporary (3:11a). 

#### It led to death (3:9a). 

#### It functioned as a veil, restricting God\'s glory (3:13-14a, 15). 

#### It prevented Christlikeness in the lives of unsaved Jews and Gentiles (3:14b). 

### The gospel of grace (3:8, 9b, 10b, 11b-12, 16-18) 

#### It is accompanied by an unfading glory (3:10b). 

#### It is eternal (3:11b). 

#### It leads to life (3:8). 

#### It functions as a mirror, reflecting God\'s glory (3:16-18). 

#### It produces Christlikeness in the lives of saved Jews and Gentiles (3:9b). 

#### It produces boldness (3:12). 

2 CORINTHIANS 4

##### He does not use secret and shameful methods (4:1-2a). 

##### He does not distort the Word of God (4:2b). 

##### He preaches Jesus and not himself (4:5). 

#### His attitude in regard to the human messenger (4:6-7) 

##### The illustration (4:6-7a): 

Paul pictures our body as a jar of clay, into which God has placed the
treasure of the gospel.

##### The implication (4:7b): 

This is done \"so everyone can see that our glorious power is from God
and is not our own.\"

### As practiced by Satan, the adversary (4:3-4): 

He blinds the minds of unbelievers, preventing them from seeing the
light of the gospel.

HOW TO HANDLE SUFFERING (4:8-18):

#### Filled with groans and sighs (5:2a)

#### Unable to see Jesus face-to-face (5:6-8) 

### The new body (5:1b, 2b, 4b-5) 

#### Referred to as a home in heaven (5:1b)

This he has accomplished by the death of Christ on the cross.

#### He has regenerated all repenting sinners (5:18-19, 21a): 

Each new believer receives a new nature.

### Our special ministry (5:11-13, 16-17, 20, 21b) 

#### The task (5:11-13, 21b): 

We have been given the ministry of reconciliation.

#### The title (5:16-17, 20): 

God looks upon us as his earthly ambassadors!

------------------------

grace of giving.

THE MONETARY GIFT BY THE CORINTHIANS (9:1-14)
