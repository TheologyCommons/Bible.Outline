responds by asking them a question they cannot answer: Who gave John the
Baptist his authority?

##### Their dilemma (20:5-6) 

###### If they say John\'s authority was \"from heaven,\" then he will ask why they didn\'t believe him (20:5). 

###### If they say John\'s authority was \"merely human,\" the people will stone them (20:6). 

##### Their defeat (20:7-8): 

They refuse to answer him, so he refuses to answer them.

#### Concerning paying tribute to Caesar (20:20-26)

Jews should pay taxes to the Romans.

belongs to him. But everything that belongs to God must be given to
him.\"

#### Concerning resurrection and marriage (20:27-40) 

##### The Sadducees\' silly example (20:27-33): 

A woman marries seven brothers and was left a widow after each marriage.
Finally, she dies. In the resurrection, whose wife will she be?

##### The Sadducees\' serious errors (20:34-40) 

###### There are no marriages as such in heaven (20:34-36).
