EZRA 1-3 
========

King Cyrus of Persia decrees that the Jews may return and rebuild the
Temple. The return of the first group of the exiles is recorded. The
offering of sacrifices is resumed, and the rebuilding of the Temple is
begun.

THE DECREE (1:1-4) 
------------------

### The prophecy (1:1): 

King Cyrus of Persia issues a decree that fulfills a prophecy made by
Jeremiah many years earlier.

### The proclamation (1:2-4): 

Cyrus\'s decree allows all the Jews in the Persian Empire to return to
Jerusalem and rebuild their Temple.

THE DONATIONS (1:6-11; 2:68-70) 
-------------------------------

### Gifts from neighbors (1:6): 

Many people, probably Jews choosing to stay in Babylon, give the
returning Jews gold, silver, and supplies for the journey.

### Gifts from King Cyrus (1:7-11): 

King Cyrus donates the valuable items that Nebuchadnezzar took from the
Temple.

### Gifts from family leaders (2:68-70): 

When the Jews arrive in Jerusalem, some family leaders already living
there donate gold, silver, and robes for the Temple and the priests.

THE DEDICATED (1:5; 2:1-67): 
----------------------------

Nearly 50,000 devoted pilgrims return, including priests, Levites,
descendants of Solomon\'s officials, and other Israelites. They bring
along 736 horses, 245 mules, 435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.

THE DETERMINATION (3:1-9): 
--------------------------

Upon their return the Jews soon accomplish three of their goals:

### The altar is rebuilt (3:1-3): 

Daily sacrifices are immediately resumed.

### The Festival of Shelters is observed (3:4-6). 

### The Temple construction is begun (3:7-9): 

In the second year after the Jews return, they begin rebuilding the
Temple, with the Levites in charge.

THE DEDICATION (3:10-13): 
-------------------------

When the Temple foundation is complete, there is a great celebration.

### The singing (3:10-11): 

The priests and Levites blow trumpets, clash cymbals, and sing praises
to the Lord.

### The sorrow (3:12-13): 

Some older Jews remember Solomon\'s glorious Temple and weep over how
much this one pales in comparison to it.

EZRA 4-6 
========

Enemies resist the rebuilding of the Temple. Artaxerxes halts the work.
Haggai and Zechariah encourage the people to continue building the
Temple. Permission is granted for the building of the Temple to
continue. The Temple is completed and dedicated, and Passover is
celebrated.

HINDRANCES TO THE PROJECT (4:1-24): 
-----------------------------------

As the Jews rebuild the temple, their enemies try to hinder them in
several ways.

### Compromise (4:1-3): 

Some enemies of the Jews try to make them compromise their standards.

#### The request (4:1-2): 

Some pagans in the land offer to aid in the Temple construction.

#### The refusal (4:3): 

The Jewish leaders decline their offer.

### Coercion (4:4-5): 

Local residents try to discourage and frighten the Jews as they rebuild.
They even bribe agents to work against the Jews.

### Condemnation (4:6-24): 

The enemies write letters to King Xerxes and King Artaxerxes, accusing

> the Jews of being rebellious.

#### The message to the king (4:6-16) 

##### The slander (4:6-13): 

The enemies warn King Artaxerxes that the Jews will revolt when the
rebuilding is complete.

##### The suggestion (4:14-16): 

The enemies suggest that King Artaxerxes check the ancient records
himself to learn of the rebellious history of Jerusalem.

#### The message from the king (4:17-24) 

##### What he discovers (4:17-20): 

Artaxerxes\' search confirms the rebellious history of Jerusalem.

##### What he demands (4:21-24): 

He orders all work on the Temple and the city to be halted immediately.

HEADWAY ON THE PROJECT (5:1-6:22): 
----------------------------------

Eventually the Temple is rebuilt, despite the many obstacles along the
way.

### The prophets in Judah (5:1-2): 

The prophets Haggai and Zechariah spur the Jews on to restart the
rebuilding of the Temple.

### The potentate in Persia (5:3-6:22) 

#### The rebuke (5:3-5): 

Again the Jews\' enemies create difficulties for them. The governor of
the province demands to know who gave them permission to rebuild the
Temple.

#### The report (5:6-16): 

The governor sends a letter to Darius, the new king of Persia, reporting
the Jews\' activities.

#### The request (5:17): 

In his letter the governor mentions the Jews\' claim that Cyrus granted
them permission to rebuild, and he asks Darius to see if this is true.

#### The reply (6:1-12): 

Persian records reveal that Cyrus had indeed granted the Jews permission
to rebuild the Temple. So Darius gives the following instructions:

##### Allow the Jews to rebuild their Temple (6:6-7). 

##### Assist the Jews in rebuilding their Temple (6:8-12): 

Darius instructs the governor to use tax revenues to fund the project.

#### The results (6:13-22) 

##### The completion of the Temple (6:13-18) 

###### The job ends (6:13-15): 

The Temple is finished during the sixth year of Darius\'s reign.

###### The joy begins (6:16-18): 

The Temple is dedicated with a joyous occasion of praise and
thanksgiving!

##### The celebration of Passover (6:19-22): 

All the returned exiles celebrate the Passover one month and nine days
after the Temple is completed.

EZRA 7-8 
========

Artaxerxes authorizes Ezra to return to Jerusalem with more exiles. The
leaders of the returning families are recorded. After gathering at the
Ahava Canal, the people depart for Jerusalem and arrive safely. They
deposit many valuables at the Temple and sacrifice burnt offerings to
God.

THE PREPARATION (7:1-10):

Many years after the first group of exiles returns to Jerusalem, a man
named Ezra comes on the scene.
