1 JOHN 1 
========

John opens his first letter with a presentation of Christ as both the
life and light of believers.

JESUS CHRIST, THE LIFE OF BELIEVERS (1:1-4) 
-------------------------------------------

### John\'s proclamation (1:1-2): 

The apostle offers a twofold description of this divine giver of life.

#### The eternal Christ (1:1a): 

He existed before the world began.

#### The earthly Christ (1:1b-2): 

John saw, heard, and touched the physical body of the Saviour.

### John\'s purpose (1:3-4): 

He writes this that we might know the two reasons for Jesus\'
incarnation.

#### The vertical reason (1:3): 

That we might experience fellowship with both the Father and Son.

#### The horizontal reason (1:4): 

That we might share our joy with one another.

JESUS CHRIST, THE LIGHT OF BELIEVERS (1:5-10) 
---------------------------------------------

### The fact (1:5): 

\"God is light and there is no darkness in him at all.\"

### The fruits (1:6-10) 

#### Negative (1:6, 8, 10): 

If we walk in darkness with unconfessed sin, we will remain barren.

#### Positive (1:7-9):

If we walk in the light and confess our sin, we will be cleansed and
fruitful.
