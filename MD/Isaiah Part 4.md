Isaiah prophesies his first three messages of woe-against Ephraim,
Jerusalem, and Lebanon.

------------------------------------------------

### The northern ten tribes (28:1-4) 

#### The sin (28:1): 

The northern kingdom has become a nation of arrogant drunkards.

#### The suffering (28:2-4): 

God will bring the Assyrians against his people, resulting in their
deportation.

#### The perversions (28:7-10, 14-15; 29:9, 15-16)

The priests and prophets are unable to carry out their responsibilities.

They attempt to hide both their sin and themselves from God.

#### The punishment (28:11-13, 16-22; 29:1-4, 10-13): 

God\'s terrible wrath upon his people will be twofold:

##### For Judah, the horrors of the Babylonian Captivity (28:11-13, 17-22; 29:1-4): 

The people refuse to listen to God, so he will send the enemy like a
flood to destroy them.

##### For all Israel, a spiritual sleep, causing the people in their blindness to later reject their own Messiah (28:16; 29:10-13): 

The events of the future have been made like a sealed book.

#### The parable (28:23-29): 

Isaiah compares God\'s workings among the nations to those of a farmer
working his soil.

ISRAEL\'S RESTORATION (28:5-6, 16; 29:5-8, 17-24) 
-------------------------------------------------

### The Redeemer (28:16): 

Jesus Christ himself is Israel\'s chief cornerstone.

### The redemption (28:5-6; 29:5-8, 17-24) 

#### He will provide justice and strength for his people (28:5-6): 

He will be the pride and joy of the remnant.

#### He will provide victory and protection for his people (29:5-8, 20, 22): 

Israel\'s enemies will disappear, and the people will no longer be
afraid.

#### He will provide healing and joy for his people (29:17-19, 21, 23-24): 

The fields will become fertile and lush, the deaf will hear, the blind
will see, and justice will prevail.

ISAIAH 30-31 
============

Isaiah prophesies his fourth and fifth messages of woe, both of which
warn against making an alliance with Egypt.

THE DEVASTATION UPON ISRAEL (30:1-14, 16-17; 31:1-3) 
----------------------------------------------------

### What Israel has done to God (30:1-11): 

They make plans with out consulting God, they demand that their prophets
cease from preaching on sin, and they listen only to soothing sermons.

### What God will do to Israel (30:12-14, 16-17) 

#### His judgment will fall on them like a bulging wall (30:12-14): 

They will be smashed like pieces of pottery.

#### A thousand of them will flee from one enemy soldier (30:16-17): 

They have put their trust in Egypt instead of in God and will be
punished for it.

THE INVITATION TO ISRAEL (30:15, 18; 31:6-7):

### Defeat their enemies (30:27-28, 30-33; 31:4-5, 8-9): 

The Lord will come and sift out the proud nations and will lead them to
destruction.

### Fill their hearts with joy (30:29): 

They will sing songs like those sung at holy festivals.
