NAHUM\'S PREDICTION OF NINEVEH\'S FALL (1:1-7, 9-15; 2:12; 3:1, 4-10) 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### The purpose (1:1-2, 7, 9-15; 2:12; 3:1, 4-10): 

God will accomplish this for two reasons:

#### To protect Judah (1:1-2, 7, 13, 15) 

##### Jehovah\'s confirmation (1:1-2, 7): 

Nahum says God is jealous over those he loves and takes vengeance on alI
who would harm them.

##### Judah\'s celebration (1:13, 15): 

The people will soon rejoice over the destruction of the cruel Assyrian
Empire.

#### To punish Nineveh (1:9-12, 14; 2:12; 3:1, 4-10): 

Her wickedness will bring down God\'s wrath. Nineveh will be destroyed
for her:

##### Defiance of God (1:9-12) 

##### Idolatry (1:14) 

##### Terrible bloodshed (2:12; 3:1) 

##### Involvement in the occult (3:4-10) 

### The power (1:3-6): 

Nahum says when sinful men (in this case the Assyrians) exhaust God\'s
patience, they face the terrible power of God\'s wrath, which is like:

#### A raging storm (1:3-5) 

#### A consuming fire (1:6)
