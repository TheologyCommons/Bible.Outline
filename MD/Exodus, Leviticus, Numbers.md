LIBERATING THE PEOPLE OF GOD (Ex. 5:1-13:22) 
--------------------------------------------

### The problems (Ex. 5:1-23) 

#### From Pharaoh (Ex. 5:1-14) 

##### Pharaoh insults the God of Israel (Ex. 5:1-3) 

###### Moses to Pharaoh: \"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: \'Let my people go.\'\" 

###### Pharaoh to Moses: \"I don\'t know the LORD, and I will not let Israel go.\" 

##### Pharaoh increases the burdens of Israel (Ex. 5:4-14): 

He forces them to gather their own straw to make bricks.

#### From the people (Ex. 5:15-23): 

Upon learning the reason for their additional burdens, the Jewish elders
become angry with Moses and Aaron. Moses, in turn, complains to God.

### The promise (Ex. 6:1-30) 

#### The nature (of the promise) (Ex. 6:1-13): 

Moses is reassured that the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob-the Lord
himself-will indeed deliver them from Egypt and lead them into the
Promised Land!

#### The names (Ex. 6:14-30): 

These verses record the families of Reuben, Simeon, and Levi (the
ancestor of Moses and Aaron).

### The prophet (Ex. 7:1-2): 

Aaron is appointed by God to serve as a prophet and spokesman for Moses.

### The power (Ex. 7:3-7): 

God will soon pour out his divine wrath upon the land of Egypt!

### The preliminaries (Ex. 7:8-13): 

When Moses and Aaron confront Pharaoh again, Pharaoh demands that they
demonstrate the power of their God. So Aaron throws down his staff,
which turns into a snake. Pharaoh\'s magicians do the same, but Aaron\'s
snake swallows up their snakes.

### The plagues (Ex. 7:14-10:29; 11:1, 4-10): 

Because Pharaoh refuses to listen, the Lord begins a series of 10
plagues on Egypt. After each plague, the Lord gives Pharaoh opportunity
to change his mind, but Pharaoh continually refuses.

#### Blood (Ex. 7:14-25): 

Moses strikes the Nile with his staff, causing its waters to change into
blood. Soon all water in Egypt is polluted in similar fashion.

A plague of frogs covers every square foot of the land. Pharaoh begs
Moses to remove them, promising Israel\'s deliverance, but then refuses
after the frogs disappear.

#### Gnats (Ex. 8:16-19): 

Aaron strikes the dust, and gnats suddenly infest the entire nation.

Pharaoh\'s magicians advise him to release Israel, but he again refuses.

#### Flies (Ex. 8:20-32): 

Egypt is filled with great swarms of flies, but none appear in the land
of Goshen, where the Israelites live. Again Pharaoh promises to set
Israel free but refuses when the flies are gone.

All Egyptian livestock suddenly become sick and begin to die, but not
one Israelite animal is affected.

#### Boils (Ex. 9:8-12): 

After Moses tosses soot from a furnace into the air, festering boils
break out on people and animals.

#### Hail and lightning (Ex. 9:13-35): 

Before this plague, God tells Moses and Pharaoh the purpose of the
plagues: \"that you might see my power and that my fame might spread
throughout the earth.\" Some Egyptians heed God\'s warning and bring
their livestock in from the fields for protection from the fearful
lightning and hail. Pharaoh tells Moses that he will let his people go
but changes his mind after the plague stops.

#### Locusts (Ex. 10:1-20): 

Pharaoh agrees to allow only the men of Israel to go worship the Lord.
Moses rejects this offer, and the Lord sends a strong east wind that
blows in the worst locust plague in Egyptian history! Pharoah repents,
the Lord removes the locusts, and then Pharaoh changes his mind yet
again.

#### Darkness (Ex. 10:21-29): 

The Lord sends a deep, terrifying darkness over all of Egypt for three
days. Pharaoh agrees to let the people go, but the flocks must stay.
Moses refuses.

The Lord tells Moses that this plague will result in Israel\'s freedom.

### The preparation (Ex. 12:1-11, 14-28):

the first month of the Hebrew calendar (in the spring). Its blood must
be sprinkled on the door frame of the home.

### The protection (Ex. 12:12-13): 

The Lord warns the people that he will \"kill all the firstborn sons and
firstborn male animals in the land of Egypt.\" But he reassures them
that \"when I see the blood, I will pass over you,\" sparing the
firstborn of the home from death.

### The panic (Ex. 12:29-33): 

Following the death of his firstborn on the fourteenth of the month,
Pharaoh summons Moses and commands him to lead Israel out of Egypt.

### The presents (Ex. 11:2-3; 12:34-36): 

The frightened Egyptians give the departing Israelites clothing and
costly gifts of silver and gold.

### The parting (Ex. 12:37-39): 

Some 600,000 men (some of whom were not Israelites), along with their
wives and children, leave Egypt that night.

### The period of time (Ex. 12:40-41): 

Israel has been in Egypt for the past 430 years.

### The Passover festival (Ex. 12:42-51): 

Foreigners are forbidden to eat the Passover lamb unless they are
circumcised. No bone of the Passover lamb is to be broken.

### The parents and children (Ex. 13:1-16): 

All firstborn Israelite sons are to be dedicated to God. Upon reaching
the Promised Land, the Israelites are to observe the Passover feast
yearly, and parents are to tell their children of God\'s faithfulness in
bringing them out of Egypt.

### The pillar of cloud and fire (Ex. 13:17-22): 

God leads his people to the Promised Land on a longer route through the
wilderness and toward the Red Sea. A pillar of cloud leads them by day,
and a pillar of fire leads them by night.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

### Phase one: Israel at the Red Sea (Ex. 14:1-18) 

#### The decision of Pharaoh: Follow up! (Ex. 14:1-9): 

Regretting his decision to free Israel, Pharaoh orders the Egyptian
army, including 600 chariots, to capture the Israelites by the Red Sea.

#### The despair of the people: Give up! (Ex. 14:10-12): 

In great fear and anger the Israelites cry out to Moses, \"Our Egyptian
slavery was far better than dying out here in the wilderness!\"

#### The declaration of Moses: Look up! (Ex. 14:13-14): 

Moses reassures them, \"Don\'t be afraid. Just stand where you are and
watch the LORD rescue you.\"

#### The decree of God: Lift up! (Ex. 14:15-18): 

Moses is told to raise his staff over the Red Sea, dividing the waters
and allowing Israel to walk across on dry ground.

### Phase two: Israel crosses the Red Sea (Ex. 14:19-15:21) 

#### The protecting (Ex. 14:19-20): 

The pillar of cloud moves between the Egyptians and the Israelites. At
night it becomes a pillar of fire once again, resulting in darkness for
the Egyptians but glorious light for the Israelites.

#### The parting (Ex. 14:21-22): 

A strong east wind blows and parts the Red Sea, forming walls of water
on each side.

Attempting to pursue the Israelites across the dry path, the Egyptians
drown when Moses lifts his hand, causing the waters to collapse on them.

In spite of the Israelites\' constant complaining, the Lord sends them
quail to eat in the evening and provides a daily supply of bread
(\"manna\") from heaven.

#### A special day (Ex. 16:23-30): 

Moses tells the people to keep the Sabbath, a weekly day of rest.

### Phase six: Israel at Rephidim (Ex. 17:1-16) 

#### The rock struck open by Moses (Ex. 17:1-7): 

At a place called Rephidim, the thirsty and rebellious Israelites
threaten to kill Moses. At God\'s command, Moses strikes a rock there,
which supernaturally gushes forth with cold, clear water!

#### The foe struck down by Moses (Ex. 17:8-16): 

Joshua leads the Israelite army to victory over the fierce Amalekites as
Moses prays for them from a nearby hill. Aaron and Hur assist Moses as
he holds up his staff during the battle.

the Israelites. He breaks the tablets containing the Ten Commandments,

===================

This outline describes the experiences of the Israelites as they travel
from Mount Sinai to Kadeshbarnea.

THE SIGNAL FROM THE SKY (Num. 10:11-12): 
----------------------------------------

\"One day in midspring \[on the twentieth day of the second month\],

0 LORD, and let your enemies be scattered! Let them flee before you!\"
Each time the cloud stops and the Ark is set down, Moses says, \"Return,
0 LORD, to the countless thousands of Israel!\"

THE SINS ALONG THE WAY (Num. 11-12) 
-----------------------------------

### The defiance and punishment of Israel (Num. 11:1-9, 31-35) 

#### First occasion (Num. 11:1-3): 

Fire falls upon some of the Israelites for complaining bitterly against
God at a place that is later called Taberah.

#### Second occasion (Num. 11:4-9, 31-35): 

Some of the foreigners accompanying Israel begin to complain, \"We
remember all the fish we used to eat for free in Egypt. And we had all
the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic that we wanted. But now
our appetites are gone, and day after day we have nothing to eat but
this manna!\" God sends quail for them to eat, but he also punishes them
with a plague.

### The despair of Moses (Num. 11: 10-30) 

#### The reason for his complaint (Num. 11:10-15): 

Moses tells God that the burden of leading a rebellious people is too
heavy to bear and he prefers death instead!

#### The results of his complaint (Num. 11:16-30) 

##### The seventy in general (Num. 11:16-25): 

God instructs Moses to summon 70 leaders to the Tabernacle. There God
anoints 70 Israelite elders with his Spirit to assist Moses in leading
the people. The leaders prophesy at this time, but that is the only time
this happens to them.

##### The two in particular (Num. 11:26-30): 

Two of these elders, Eldad and Medad, are absent when the others meet
together, but they begin prophesying in the camp. Moses tells Joshua not
to stop them, saying, \"I wish that all the LORD\'s people were
prophets, and that the LORD would put his Spirit upon them all!\"

#### The disrespect of Miriam and Aaron (Num. 12:1-16) 

##### The reasons for their disrespect (Num. 12:1-3): 

Miriam and Aaron (Moses\' sister and brother) criticize Moses for two
reasons:

###### He has married a Cushite woman. 

###### He has been given greater authority over the Israelites.

God sternly rebukes Miriam and Aaron. Miriam is struck with leprosy.
Aaron begs Moses to pray for their sister, so her leprosy is healed.

Land. Among them are Caleb from the tribe of Judah and Joshua from the
tribe of Ephraim.

### The nature of the mission (Num. 13:17-25): 

Moses instructs the scouts to do two things:

#### Find out what the inhabitants are like (Num. 13:17-19)

THE LAMENTATION BY THE PEOPLE (Num. 13:26-33-14:10) 
---------------------------------------------------

### The report of the scouts (Num. 13:26-33; 14:6-10) 

#### The faithless report of the ten (Num. 13:26-33): 

\"The people living there are powerful, and their cities and towns are
fortified and very large \.... We even saw giants there, the descendants
of Anak. We felt like grasshoppers next to them, and that\'s what we
looked like to them!\"

#### The faithful report of the two (Num. 14:6-10): 

\"The land we explored is a wonderful land! And if the LORD is pleased
with us, he will bring us safely into that land and give it to us\....
Do not rebel against the LORD, and don\'t be afraid of the people of the
land\.... They have no protection, but the LORD is with us!\"

### The reaction of the crowd (Num. 14:1-5): 

Upon hearing the report of the ten scouts, the people become worried and
make plans to return to Egypt.

THE SUPPLICATION (PRAYER) BY THE PROPHET (Num. 14:11-21)

The Lord becomes angry with the Israelites and says to Moses, \"I will
disown them and destroy them with a plague. Then I will make you into a
nation far greater and mightier than they are!\"

### The plea (Num. 14:13-19): 

Moses begs the Lord to pardon Israel, lest the pagans say, \"The LORD
was not able to bring them into the land he swore to give them, so he
killed them in the wilderness.\"

### The pardon (Num. 14:20-21): 

The Lord forgives his people, although there will still be consequences.

THE CONDEMNATION BY THE LORD (Num. 14:22-45) 
--------------------------------------------

### The punishment (Num. 14:22-38): 

The Lord spares the people of Israel from complete destruction as a
nation, but they will still be punished: No one 20 years old or older
(with the exceptions of Caleb and Joshua) will enter the Promised Land.
They will wander in the wilderness for the next 40 years until all of
them die and a new generation is born. The 10 faithless scouts die
immediately from a plague.

The fickle crowd now decide they want to enter the Promised Land after
all, but they are completely routed by their enemies.

alive! Fire blazes from the Lord and burns up Korah\'s followers who are
offering incense.

##### At the rest (Num. 16:41-50) 

###### The rebellion (Num. 16:41-42): 

The next morning people confront Moses and Aaron, saying, \"You two have
killed the LORD\'S people!\"

###### The response (Num. 16:43-46): 

The Lord sends a plague on the people to destroy them.

###### The rescue (Num. 16:47-50): 

Aaron burns incense and makes atonement for the people in order to stop
the plague. Before it stops, 14,700 Israelites die.

### The people of Edom (Num. 20:14-22): 

The Israelites ask the Edomites if they can pass through their land
quickly and peacefully. The Edomites refuse, despite the fact that they
are descended from Jacob\'s twin brother, Esau.

### The prophet Balaam (Num. 22:1-24:25): 

King Balak of Moab sees that the Israelites are numerous and powerful,
so he begins to fear for his kingdom. He sends for a prophet named
Balaam to come and curse the Israelites.

#### Balaam\'s foolishness (Num. 22:1-41) 

##### The warning from God (Num. 22:1-21): 

God forbids Balaam to accept a bribe from King Balak of Moab to curse
Israel. However, God does permit the prophet to accompany Balak\'s
messengers to Moab.

##### The wrath of God (Num. 22:22-27): 

En route, Balaam\'s donkey is frightened by something Balaam cannot
see-God\'s angel standing in the road with a drawn sword! Unaware of
this, the angry prophet beats his seemingly unruly animal.

##### The witnesses for God (Num. 22:28-34): 

Balaam is rebuked by his donkey, who complains about its undeserved
beating! Now Balaam sees the angel, who then rebukes him for coming.

##### The words from God (Num. 22:35-41): 

In essence, Balaam is warned to speak only what God tells him to. Upon
arriving in Moab, the prophet relates all this to Balak.

#### Balaam\'s frustration (Num. 23:1-24:25): 

Five times Balaam stands over the people of Israel and is unable to
curse them.

##### First occasion (Num. 23:1-12): 

\"How can I curse those whom God has not cursed? \... I see a people who
live by themselves, set apart from other nations. Who can count Jacob\'s
descendants, as numerous as dust?\"

##### Second occasion (Num. 23:13-24): 

\"God is not a man, that he should lie\.... I received a command to
bless\.... No misfortune is in sight for Jacob\.... God has brought them
out of Egypt\.... No curse can touch Jacob\.... These people rise up
like a lioness.\"

##### Third occasion (Num. 23:25-24:9): 

\"How beautiful are your tents, 0 Jacob \.... \[You are\] like fruitful
gardens by the riverside\.... \[You are\] like cedars beside the
waters\.... \[Your\] kingdom will be exalted\.... Blessed is everyone
who blesses you, 0 Israel.\"

##### Fourth occasion (Num. 24:10-19): 

\"I see him, but not in the present time. I perceive him, but far in the
distant future. A star will rise from Jacob; a scepter will emerge from
Israel. It will crush the foreheads of Moab\'s people.\"

##### Fifth occasion (Num. 24:20-25): 

Balaarn predicts divine judgment on Moab and other pagan nations:
\"Alas, who can survive when God does this?\"

THE TRAGEDY (Num. 20:2-13) 
--------------------------

### The disbelief of Israel (Num. 20:2-6): 

When the Israelites run out of water, they blame Moses and lament the
fact that they are not back in Egypt.

### The directive of God (Num. 20:7-8): 

The Lord tells Moses to assemble the people and command a rock to give
them water.

### The disobedience of Moses (Num. 20:9-13): 

After the rebellious people are assembled, Moses\' anger causes him to
cry out, \"Must we bring you water from this rock?\" He disobeys the
Lord\'s command and strikes the rock twice. The water still comes out,
but Moses pays a sad price for his disobedience: he cannot lead the
people into the Promised Land.

THE TRIUMPHS (Num. 21:1-4, 21-35; 31:1-54): 
-------------------------------------------

The Lord gives Israel several victories on their way to the Promised
Land.

### Over the king of Arad (Num. 21:1-4): 

The Canaanite king of Arad attacks the Israelites and takes some of them
as prisoners. But the Israelites counterattack, and God gives them total
victory.

### Over King Sihon (Num. 21:21-32): 

King Sihon of the Amorites refuses the Israelites\' peaceful request for
passage and attacks them, but he suffers total destruction.

### Over King Og (Num. 21:33-35): 

This giant warrior king of Bashan (Deut. 3:11) is killed by the
Israelites, along with his sons and his entire army.

#### The battle (Num. 31:1-12): 

Twelve thousand crack Israelite soldiers (1,000 from each tribe) are
chosen to battle the Midianites. All five Midianite kings are killed,
along with the prophet Balaam.

#### The bungling (Num. 31:13-24): 

Moses is angry with the army officers for sparing some Midianite women
who had previously sexually seduced many Israelite men.

#### The booty (Num. 31:25-54): 

At God\'s command, half of the war spoils are kept by the soldiers and
half are given to the people. This includes 675,000 sheep, 72,000
cattle, 61,000 donkeys, and 32,000 young girls.

THE TRANSITIONS (Num. 20:1, 23-29; 27:12-23)

Hor and there transfer the clothing (and office) of Israel\'s high
priest from father to son.

Aaron dies and is buried on Mount Hor. The people then mourn for Aaron
for 30 days.

Eleazar now becomes Israel\'s second high priest.

Moses is to climb a mountain and view the Promised Land, for he must
soon die.

##### The ceremony (Num. 27:15-23): 

Joshua is appointed as Israel\'s new leader. In a public ceremony Moses
lays hands on Joshua and passes the torch of leadership to him.

---------------------------------

### The sin of the crowd (Num. 25:1-5, 9) 

#### Their perversion (Num. 25:1-3): 

Shortly after the Balaam incident, many Israelite men engage in sexual
immorality with Moabite women. Then they commit idolatry by bowing to
their pagan gods.

Midianite woman into the camp in full view of Moses.

In righteous indignation, Phinehas, son of Eleazar, enters the couple\'s
tent and kills them with his spear.

THE TABULATIONS (SECOND CENSUS) (Num. 26:1-65):

THE TYPES (Num. 17:1-13; 19:1-22; 21:4-9; 32:1-42; 35:6-34): 
------------------------------------------------------------

Many scholars see symbolic representations, or \"types,\" in many of the
images found in the book of Numbers.

### Types of Christ (Num. 17:1-13; 19:1-22; 21:5-9; 35:6-34) 

#### The death of Christ (Num. 19:1-22; 21:5-9) 

##### The red heifer (Num. 19:1-22): 

A blemish-free red heifer is to be killed and its blood sprinkled seven
times toward the Tabernacle. The carcass is then to be burned, mixed
with cedarwood, hyssop, and scarlet thread. The ashes are to be used for
purification.

##### The brass serpent (Num. 21:5-9): 

Poisonous snakes are sent to punish rebellious Israel. In response to
the people\'s prayer for forgiveness, God instructs Moses: \"Make a
replica of a poisonous snake and attach it to the top of a pole. Those
who are bitten will live if they simply look at it!\"

#### The resurrection of Christ (Num. 17:1-13): 

Aaron\'s rod has also been seen as a type of Christ\'s resurrection.

##### God\'s message (Num. 17:1-5): 

Responding to a challenge to Aaron\'s leadership, God orders Aaron and
each of Israel\'s tribal leaders to place their staffs in the
Tabernacle.

##### God\'s miracle (Num. 17:6-13): 

The next day only Aaron\'s staff has budded, is blossoming, and has ripe
almonds hanging from it!

#### The security in Christ (Num. 35:6-34): 

Six cities, three on the west of the Jordan River and three on the east,
are designated as refuges for those who have accidentally killed
someone. These people can safely enter and be protected from any of the
victim\'s relatives who seek revenge.

### A type of worldly believer (Num. 32:1-42): 

The three tribes east of the Jordan River have been compared to worldly
believers today.

#### The request (Num. 32:1-5): 

The tribes of Reuben and Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh seek
permission from Moses to live on the eastern side of the Jordan River.

#### The reprimand (Num. 32:6-15): 

Moses asks, \"Do you mean you want to stay back here while your brothers
go across and do all the fighting? \... Are you trying to discourage the
rest of the people of Israel from going across to the land the LORD has
given them?\"

#### The reassurance (Num. 32:16-32): 

The 2 tribes solemnly promise to fully support the other 9½ tribes in
conquering Canaan.

#### The results (Num. 32:33-42): 

Moses grants their request.

River in the east. The 2½ tribes will live just east of the Jordan
River.

#### Areas assigned to the religious tribe (Num. 35:1-5): 

The tribe of Levi is to be given 48 cities throughout the land.

THE TENACITY (Num. 27:1-11; 36:1-13) 
------------------------------------

### The request (Num. 27:1-11): 

Inasmuch as their dead father had no sons, the five daughters of
Zelophehad request that they be allowed to inherit his land. The Lord
instructs Moses to grant this request, but with one qualification.

In order to inherit the land, the daughters must marry men within their
tribe of Manasseh, which they do.
