Sennacherib and the glorious deliverance by the Lord.

HEZEKIAH AND THE ASSYRIAN DANGER (36:1-22; 37:1-20): 
----------------------------------------------------

Just prior to attacking Jerusalem, King Sennacherib of Assyria sends his
military commander to threaten, ridicule, and intimidate King Hezekiah
and his people.

### Sennacherib and Hezekiah-Round One (36:1-22; 37:1-7) 

#### The men from the king (36:1-3): 

Three of Hezekiah\'s top officials-Eliakim, Shebna, and Joahmeet with
Sennacherib\'s military commander.

#### The message to the king (36:4-21): 

In essence the commander\'s warning is twofold:

##### What Judah cannot do (36:4-12, 18-21) 

###### They cannot depend on Egypt (36:4-6): 

Pharaoh is unreliable.

###### They cannot depend on God (36:7-12, 18-21): 

Hezekiah has insulted God.

##### What Judah should do (36:13-17): 

In a word, surrender!

#### The misery of the king (36:22; 37:1): 

Hezekiah tears his clothes and dresses in sackcloth.

#### The man of God and the king (37:2-7) 

##### Hezekiah\'s request to Isaiah (37:2-4): 

The king informs Isaiah of the terrible danger and begs him to pray for
God\'s help.

##### Hezekiah\'s reassurance from Isaiah (37:5-7): 

Isaiah tells the king that his foe Sennacherib will soon experience
defeat and death.

### Sennacherib and Hezekiah-Round Two (37:8-20) 

#### The Assyrian king to the Judean king (37:8-13): 

\"I\'lI destroy you!\"

#### The Judean king to the King of kings (37:14-20): 

\"Please deliver us!\"

HEZEKIAH AND THE ANGELIC DELIVERIANCE (37:21-38) 
------------------------------------------------

### God condemns Sennacherib (37:21-29). 

#### His pride (37:21-28): 

The wicked king arrogantly ridicules the Holy One of Israel.

#### His punishment (37:29): 

Sennacherib will be led back to Assyria with a hook in his nose and a
bit in his mouth.

### God consoles Hezekiah (37:30-38). 

#### The promises (37:30-35): 

God assures the king of two things:

##### The land will soon enjoy abundant crops (37:30-32): 

In the third year, the people will be able to plant crops and vineyards.

##### The Assyrians will never enter Jerusalem (37:33-35): 

God will defend the city.

#### The power (37:36-38): 

That very night God\'s angel destroys 185,000 Assyrian troops!
Sennacherib flees back to Nineveh, where he is killed by his own sons.

as a sign to assure him that he will be healed.

### The summary by the king (38:9-22)

##### He feels betrayed (38:9-12): 

It seems unfair to be cut down while in the prime of life.

back, this time to plunder and enslave the people of Judah.

during my lifetime!\"
