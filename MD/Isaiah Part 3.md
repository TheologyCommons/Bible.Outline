ISAIAH 24-25 
============

Isaiah prophesies universal judgment and God\'s ultimate triumph over
evil.

THE COMING GREAT TRIBULATION (24:1-13, 16b-22): 
-----------------------------------------------

While the immediate context here may refer to the devastation of Judah
following the Babylonian captivity, it would seem to have its ultimate
fulfillment during the Great Tribulation.

### The Great Tribulation-what it is (24:1-4, 6-13, 16b-22) 

#### God himself will lay waste to the entire earth (24:1): 

The earth will become a great wasteland, and the people will be
scattered.

#### All people and fallen angels will be judged (24:2-4, 21-22): 

No one will be spared from God\'s wrath, and the fallen angels will be
put in prison.

#### Very few will survive (24:6): 

A curse will consume the earth and its people, who will be destroyed by
fire.

#### Happiness will no longer exist (24:7-13): 

All joy in life will be gone.

#### Evil and treachery will be everywhere (24:16b-18): 

People possessed by sheer terror will flee from one danger only to be
confronted with something even more horrifying.

#### The earth will stagger like a drunkard (24:19-20): 

It will fall and collapse like a tent, unable to rise again because of
the weight of its sins.

### The Great Tribulation-why it occurs (24:5): 

Humanity has twisted the laws of God and has broken his holy commands.

THE COMING GLORIOUS MILLENNIUM (24:14-16a, 23; 25:1-12) 
-------------------------------------------------------

### The promise (24:14-16a, 23) 

#### Joy and singing will fill the earth (24:14-16a): 

The people will shout and sing for joy, declaring God\'s majesty.

#### God\'s glory will outshine the sun (24:23): 

He will rule gloriously from Jerusalem.

### The praises (25:1-12): 

Isaiah now worships and exalts God for the following:

#### His faithfulness (25:1): 

God promises wonderful things, and he accomplishes them.

#### His salvation of the Gentiles (25:2-3): 

Strong nations will declare his glory, and ruthless nations will adore
him.

#### His mercy (25:4-5): 

He is kind to the poor and needy.

#### His provision (25:6-7): 

He will spread a feast for everyone and will remove the cloud of gloom
hanging over the earth.

#### His victory over death (25:8): 

He will swallow up death forever.

#### His restoration of Israel (25:9): 

Israel will rejoice in his salvation.

#### His judgment of his enemies (25:10-12): 

God will destroy the Moabites and will end their evil works.

ISAIAH 26-27 
============

These chapters, recorded in the lyrics of two songs, contain Isaiah\'s
messages of God\'s ultimate exaltation of Israel.

STANZA ONE-ISRAEL\'S SAVIOR (26:1-15): 
--------------------------------------

This part of the song will be sung as Israel\'s testimony to God during
the Millennium. It will do three things:

### Thank God for his strength and peace (26:1-6) 

### Thank God for his righteous judgment (26:7-11) 

### Thank God for his uniqueness (26:12-15): 

He alone, unlike the dead idols Israel once worshiped, is the true and
only God.

STANZA TWO-ISRAEL\'S SUFFERING (26:16-18; 27:7-11): 
---------------------------------------------------

It will speak of two things:

### The sin (26:16; 27:7-11): 

God himself allows Israel\'s suffering as punishment for sin.

### The symbol (26:17-18): 

Israel suffers as a woman giving birth.

STANZA THREE-ISRAEL\'S SALVATION (26:19; 27:12-13): 
---------------------------------------------------

Israel will experience two things:

### Resurrection from the dead (26:19) 

### Restoration to the land (27:12-13) 

STANZA FOUR-ISRAEL\'S SECURITY (Isaiah 26:20-21; 27:1-6): 
---------------------------------------------------------

Israel will enjoy two things:

### Protection during the Great Tribulation (Isaiah 26:20-21; 27:1) 

### Productivity during the glorious Millennium (Isaiah 27:2-6)
