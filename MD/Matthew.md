### The enemies of God will hate them (10:16-18, 23). 

#### Religious persecution (10:16-17): 

They will be handed over to courts and beaten in synagogues.

#### Political persecution (10:18): 

They will be called before governors and kings; this will give them a
chance to witness.

TO FAITHFUL DISCIPLES, LIVING THROUGHOUT CHURCH HISTORY (10:24-42): 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Jesus speaks of discipleship and persecution.

### The certainty (10:24-25): 

Just as he is persecuted, his disciples also will be.

### The confidence (10:26-31) 

#### What people may do (10:26-28): 

They may kill the body, but they cannot touch the soul.

#### What God will do (10:29-31): 

He cares for both body and soul.

### The conflict (10:34-36): Faith in Christ may well turn a person\'s family against him or her! 

### The conditions (10:37-38) 

#### The priority of our love for Christ (10:37): 

We are to place him even above our families!

#### The proof of our love for Christ (10:38): 

We are to take up our cross and follow him.

MATTHEW 12
==========

Jesus heals the sick, confronts the Pharisees, and fulfills ancient
prophecies.

JESUS AND THE PHARISEES (12:1-14, 22-45) 
----------------------------------------

On three separate occasions, Jesus is confronted by these wicked men.

### The Sabbath conflict (12:1-14): 

The Pharisees take issue with Jesus when he performs his miracles.

#### In regard to eating on the Sabbath (12:1-8): 

Jesus is criticized by the Pharisees for allowing his disciples to pluck
some heads of grain from a field on the Sabbath. The Savior reports by
pointing out two facts:

##### The purpose of the Sabbath (12:1-7): 

The Sabbath was made for man, and not the reverse!

###### As seen in the life of David (12:3-4): 

David and his men ate the bread reserved for the priests.

###### As seen in the law of Moses (12:5-6): 

The priests are allowed to serve in the Temple on the Sabbath.

###### As seen in the Book of Hosea (12:7): 

God wants them to be merciful; he doesn\'t care that much about their
sacrifices.

##### The person of the Sabbath (12:8): 

The Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath!

#### In regard to healing on the Sabbath (12:9-14): 

Jesus notices a man with a deformed hand.

##### The accusation (12:9-10): 

The Pharisees ask Jesus whether it is legal to work by healing on the
Sabbath day.

##### The answer (12:11-12): 

Jesus replies by asking them if they would rescue a sheep on the
Sabbath.

He says, \"Of course you would! And how much more valuable is a person
than a sheep!\"

##### The action by the Savior (12:13-14): 

He heals the man\'s hand.

### The source conflict (12:22-37): 

The Pharisees claim that Satan is the source of Jesus\' miracles. On
this occasion Jesus has just healed a demon-possessed, blind, mute man.

#### The criticism by the Pharisees (12:22-29) 

##### Their accusation (12:22-24): 

\"He gets his power from Satan, the prince of demons.\"

##### His argument (12:25-29) 

###### \"A city or home divided against itself is doomed\" (12:25). 

###### \"If Satan is casting out Satan, he is fighting against himself\" (12:26-29). 

#### The condemnation of the Pharisees (12:30-37) 

##### Jesus says their sin is terrible (12:30-34). 

###### They are corrupt fruit trees (12:30-33): 

A tree is known by its fruit.

###### They are poisonous snakes (12:34): 

Whatever is in their hearts determines what they say.

##### Jesus says their sin is terminal (12:35-37): 

The words they say now will determine their fate on judgment day.

### The sign conflict (12:38-45): 

The Pharisees insist that Jesus do something spectacular just for them.

#### Jesus refers to Jonah and Nineveh (12:38-41). 

##### The illustration from the life of the prophet of God (12:38-40): 

Jonah\'s experience in the belly of the fish depicts Jesus\' death and
resurrection; this is the only sign he gives them!

##### The indictment from the lips of the people of Nineveh (12:41): 

The Ninevites will someday condemn Jesus\' generation, for Nineveh
repented at the preaching of Jonah, but Jesus is greater than Jonah.

#### Jesus refers to Solomon and the Queen of Sheba (12:42): 

She will condemn Jesus\' generation because she had great respect for
Solomon, and Jesus is greater than Solomon.

#### Jesus refers to eight evil spirits (12:43-45): 

Here Jesus likens his generation to a demonpossessed man.

##### The first state of the man (12:43): 

The original demon living within him departs.

##### The final state of the man (12:44-45): 

Unable to find another person to indwell, the spirit returns to the man,
this time bringing seven other spirits more wicked than himself.

JESUS AND THE PROPHECIES (12:15-21): 
------------------------------------

Jesus fulfills the prophecies of Isaiah, who predicted the earthly
ministry of the Messiah (Isa. 42:1-4).

### Jesus\' heavenly relationships (12:18a-1 8b) 

#### Concerning the Father (12:18a): 

The Father would love him.

#### Concerning the Spirit (12:18b): 

The Spirit would fill him.

### Jesus\' earthly actions (12:15-17, 18c-21) 

#### Concerning the nations (12:18c, 21): 

He would proclaim justice to the nations.

#### Concerning himself (12:19): 

He would not be quarrelsome or rebellious.

#### Concerning the weak and hopeless (12:20): 

He would treat them with gentleness and understanding.

#### Concerning the sick (12:15-17): 

He would heal the sick.

JESUS AND HIS FAMILY (12:46-50) 
-------------------------------

### His earthly family (12:46-47): 

Jesus is told his mother and brothers are waiting to meet with him.

### His eternal family (12:48-50): 

He says all who obey his heavenly Father are part of his family!

MATTHEW 13
==========

Jesus explains the Kingdom of Heaven using eight parables.

THE RELATING OF HIS PARABLES (13:1-8, 18-33, 36-50, 52) 
-------------------------------------------------------

### The sower, the seed, and the soil (13:1-8, 18-23) 

#### Information in this parable (13:1-8): 

A farmer sows grain, which falls upon four different kinds of soil,
producing four different results.

##### Roadside soil (13:1-4): 

This seed is soon devoured by the birds.

This seed springs up quickly but soon withers, being scorched by the
sun.

##### Thorn-infested soil (13:7): 

This seed is quickly choked by the thorns.

##### Fertile soil (13:8): 

This seed produces a thirty, sixty, and even hundredfold crop!

#### Interpretation of this parable (13:18-23) 

##### The seed (13:18-19a): 

The seed represents the Good News about the Kingdom.

##### The roadside soil (13:19b): 

The hard soil represents those who hear the message but do not
understand it, thus allowing Satan to steal it from them.

##### The rocky soil (13:20-21): 

The shallow, rocky soil represents those who have no depth and thus drop
out upon encountering any trouble or persecution.

##### The thorn-infested soil (13:22): 

The thorny ground represents those who allow the lure of wealth to snuff
out the Good News.

##### Fertile soil (13:23): 

The good soil represents those who truly accept God\'s message,
producing an abundant harvest.

### The wheat and the thistle (13:24-30, 36-43) 

#### Information in the parable (13:24-30) 

##### The diligence of a sower (13:24): 

A farmer sows good seed throughout his field.

##### The discovery by the sower (13:25-28): 

He learns his enemy later secretly visited the field and sowed thistles
among the wheat.

##### The dilemma of the sower (13:29): 

He knows that if he attempts to pull out the thistles, he will also harm
the wheat.

##### The decision of the sower (13:30): 

He will wait until harvest time, when he will sort out the thistles from
the wheat and burn them.

#### Interpretation of the parable (13:36-43) 

##### The sower is Christ (13:36-37). 

##### The enemy is the devil (13:39a). 

##### The field is the world (13:38a). 

##### The good seed is believers (13:38b). 

##### The thistles are unbelievers (13:38c). 

##### The harvest is the end of the age (13:39b). 

##### The reapers are angels (13:39c-41). 

##### The granary is heaven (13:43). 

##### The furnace is hell(13:42). 

### The mustard seed (13:31-32) 

#### It goes into the ground the smallest of seeds (13:31-32a). 

#### It grows out of the ground the largest of plants (13:32b). 

### The yeast (13:33) 

#### It is placed in the flour (13:33a): 

Only a small amount of yeast is used.

#### It permeates every part of the dough (13:33b). 

### The treasure in the field (13:44) 

#### The discovery (13:44a): 

A man finds a precious treasure.

#### He buys this pearl (13:46). 

### The sorting of fish (13:47-50) 

#### The information in this parable (13:47-48): 

Upon catching a net filled with fish, the fishermen sort out the good
from the bad.

#### The interpretation of this parable (13:49-50): 

At the end of the world, the angels will likewise separate the righteous
from the wicked.

### The homeowner and his treasure (13:52): 

A wise teacher of God\'s Word can display both old and new precious
truths like a homeowner can show off both old and new treasures.

THE REASON FOR HIS PARABLES (13:9-17, 34-35, 51) 
------------------------------------------------

### The purpose (13:9-13, 34-35, 51): 

Jesus uses his parables to accomplish a twofold goal.

#### To reveal God\'s truth to the righteous (13:9-12a, 34-35, 51) 

#### To conceal God\'s truth from the unrighteous (13:12b-13) 

### The prophecy (13:14-17): 

Isaiah predicted that Israel would not be able to understand or accept
the truths in Christ\'s parables (Isa. 6:9-10).

THE REACTION TO HIS PARABLES (13:53-58): 
----------------------------------------

The people in Jesus\' hometown of Nazareth react to his parables in a
twofold way.

### First they are amazed (13:53-56). 

### Then they are angered (13:57-58): 

Jesus does only a few miracles there because of their unbelief.

first fish he catches, and use the coin he will find there to pay the
tax!

MATTHEW 18
==========

Jesus addresses the issues of how to determine greatness, how to escape
hell, how to exercise church discipline, and how to forgive a sinning
brother.

HOW TO DETERMINE GREATNESS (18:1-6, 10-14) 
------------------------------------------

### The illustration of a little child (18:1-5) 

#### The statement (18:1-4): 

True greatness is to humble oneself as a little child.

#### The spiritual truth (18:5): 

To honor a little child is to honor the Savior himself.

### The ill treatment of a little child (18:6, 10-14) 

#### The penalty (18:6): 

It is better for a person to have a large millstone hung around the neck
and be cast into the sea than to mistreat a little child!

#### The protection (18:10): 

Angels are assigned to protect children.

#### The priority (18:11-14): 

In the parable of the lost sheep, Jesus says that it is the will of his
Father to bring all little ones into the safety of the sheepfold.

HOW TO ESCAPE HELL (18:7-9): In highly metaphorical language, Jesus says: 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Control what you do (18:7-8): 

If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off!

### Control what you see (18:9): 

If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out!

HOW TO EXERCISE CHURCH DISCIPLINE (18:15-20) 
--------------------------------------------

### The procedure (18:15-17) 

#### If your brother sins against you, go to him in private, and attempt to reconcile the matter (18:15). 

#### If this fails, take someone with you (18:16). 

#### If this fails, bring the matter before the church (18:17a). 

#### If this fails, dismiss the unrepentant brother (18:17b). 

### The promise (18:18-20): 

The authority of heaven itself will support this kind of church
decision.

HOW TO FORGIVE YOUR BROTHER (18:21-35) 
--------------------------------------

### The percentage (18:21-22) 

#### Peter to Jesus (18:21): 

\"How often should I forgive someone who sins against me? Seven times?\"

#### Jesus to Peter (18:22):

on you?\"

MATTHEW 19
==========

Jesus teaches about divorce and tells his disciples that one must be
childlike in order to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. He also talks about
the difficulty of having both worldly riches and spiritual riches.

PART ONE (19:1-15) 
------------------

### The confrontation\--Jesus and the Pharisees (19:1-9): 

The wicked Pharisees ask Jesus two trick questions, and Jesus answers
them.

#### What they ask-first question (19:3): 

\"Should a man be allowed to divorce his wife for any reason?\"

#### How he answers-first reply (19:4-6): 

\"\'A man \... is joined to his wife, and the two are united into one.\'
. . . Let no one separate them, for God has joined them together.\"

#### What they ask-second question (19:7): 

\"Then why did Moses say a man could merely write an official letter of
divorce and send her away?\"

#### How he answers-second reply (19:8-9) 

##### The insolence (19:8a): 

Moses only allowed it due to the hardness of their hearts!

##### The intention (19:8b): 

Divorce was not God\'s original intention!

##### The immorality (19:9): 

The man who unlawfully divorces his wife and remarries commits adultery!

### The clarification-Jesus and his disciples (19:10-12) 

#### What they ask (19:10): \"

Then it is better not to marry!\"

#### How he answers (19:11-12): 

This is true only for those whom God has called to remain single.

### The consecration-Jesus and some little children (19:13-15) 

#### The disciples rebuke the parents (19:13): 

They scold the parents for \"bothering\" Jesus with their request that
he bless their little ones.

###### The Savior\'s conclusion (19:21): 

\"If you want to be perfect, go and selI all you have and give the money
to the poor\.... Then come, follow me.\"

##### The sorrowing ruler (19:22): 

He turns away with sadness, not willing to give up his wealth.

#### Jesus and the disciples (19:23-26)

than for a rich man to enter heaven.

##### The amazement (19:25): 

The disciples ask who can possibly be saved.

##### The assurance (19:26): 

Jesus says with God all things are possible.

MATTHEW 20
==========

Jesus tells the parable of the vineyard workers, again predicts his
death, receives a peculiar request from the mother of James and John,
and heals two blind men.

THE PARABLE (20:1-16) 
---------------------

### The analogy (20:1a): 

Here Jesus likens the kingdom of heaven to a landowner who hires men to
work in his vineyard.

### The agreement (20:1b-7) 

#### The work wages (20:2): 

He agrees to pay each worker one denarius per day.

#### The work schedule (20:1b, 3-7) 

##### Some work from 6:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. (20:1b). 

##### Some work from 9:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. (20:3-4). 

##### Some work from noon to 6:00 P.M. (20:5a). 

##### Some work from 3:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M. (20:5b). 

##### Some work from 5:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M. (20:6-7). 

### The argument (20:8-15) 

#### The payoff (20:8): 

In the evening the owner instructs his foreman to pay them their wages,
beginning with the last one hired and going on to the first.

#### The pay (20:9-10): 

Each worker receives identical wages-one denarius!

#### The protest (20:11-12): 

The workers who began at 6:00 A.M. protest that they should receive more
than the late-afternoon workers.

#### The pronouncement (20:13-15): 

The owner reminds the complainers of two things.

##### He has paid them what he promised (20:13). 

##### He can pay anyone anything he wants (20:14-15). 

### The application (20:16): 

Jesus says the last will be first, and the first, last!

THE PREDICTION (20:17-19): 
--------------------------

Jesus predicts two events in regard to himself.

### The grievous event (20:17-19a) 

#### His betrayal by Judas (20:17-18a): 

He will be betrayed to the priests.

#### His condemnation by the Jewish leaders (20:18b): 

He wiII be sentenced to death.

### The glorious event (20:19b): 

He will rise again on the third day!

THE PETITION (20:20-28) 
-----------------------

### The request (20:20-21): 

The mother of James and John asks Jesus to allow her two sons to sit on
his right and left side in the Kingdom.

### The response (20:22-23): 

Jesus denies this favor on two counts:

#### Their ignorance (20:22) 

Neither the mother or the sons really understand what they are asking!

#### His inability (20:23): 

Seating arrangements in the Kingdom will be assigned by the Father, not
the Son!

### The resentment (20:24): 

The other ten disciples are indignant when they hear what James and John
asked.

### The requirement (20:25-28): 

Jesus uses this tense situation to set forth the conditions for true
greatness.

#### Greatness as viewed by the Gentiles (20:25): 

Greatness to them is the powerful lording of their authority over
others.

#### Greatness as viewed by God (20:26-28): 

It consists of becoming a servant to others!

THE PITY (20:29-34) 
-------------------

### The cries of the blind (20:29-30): 

Two blind men cry out to Jesus as he passes by.

### The criticism of the crowd (20:31): 

The people tell them to be quiet.

others, whom he can trust.

#### The witness (21:42):

occasions.

Why? Because people will be like the angels in heaven.

##### There will be a resurrection (22:31-33): 

Why? Because God is not the God of the dead but of the living.

### Third occasion: Concerning the greatest commandment (22:34-40):

\"Which is the greatest commandment in the law?\"

Jesus gives them both the greatest and second greatest of all the
commandments.

in yourselves.\"

twice the son of hell as you yourselves are.\"

#### Third judgment (23:16-22)

inside you are filthy-full of greed and self-indulgence!\"

the inside with dead people\'s bones and all sorts of impurity.\"

#### Seventh judgment (23:29-36) 

##### \"You will become guilty of murdering all the godly people from righteous Abel to Zechariah\" (23:29-35). 

###### By their ancestors\' hands (23:29-31): 

They admit that they are descendants of those who killed the prophets.

###### By their own hands (23:32-35): 

They will kill those sent to warn them.

##### \"All the accumulated judgment of the centuries will break upon the heads of this very generation\" (23:36).

Jesus relates this parable to explain the Kingdom of Heaven, comparing
it to ten bridesmaids who go out to meet the bridegroom.

### The people (25:2-4)

yourselves.\"

Maintain a diligent watch, and be prepared for the bridegroom\'s return!

THE PARABLE OF THE TALENTS (25:14-30)

three servants before going to another country.

goats.
