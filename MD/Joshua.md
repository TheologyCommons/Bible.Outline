JOSHUA 6-8
==========

In this central campaign, Joshua leads Israel to victory at Jericho, but
he encounters defeat at Ai before Achan\'s sin is discovered and
removed. After the blessings and curses of the law are read as Moses had
commanded (Deut. 27:2-8), the central part of the land is secure.

THE TWO CITIES (6:1-8:29): 
--------------------------

The Israelites attack two cities, Jericho and Ai, during the central
campaign.

### Jericho (6:1-27): 

This strongly fortified city is the Israelites\' first military
encounter in Canaan.

#### The commands (6:1-11): 

The Israelites are given specific instructions for conquering Jericho.

##### Action during the first six days (6:1-4): 

For six days, the Israelites are to walk around the city once a day, led
by seven priests blowing rams\' horns.

##### Action during the final day (6:4-11): 

On the seventh day, the Israelites are to walk around

> the city seven times; at a given signal, they are to give a mighty
> shout. The walls will then collapse!

#### The conquest (6:12-21): 

The Israelites follow the Lord\'s commands, and the walls fall down,
allowing them to take the city.

#### The clemency (6:22-25): 

As previously agreed, Rahab and her entire family are spared.

#### The curse (6:26-27): 

Joshua places a curse on anyone attempting to rebuild Jericho. The
builder\'s oldest son will die when the foundation is laid, and his
youngest son will die when the gates are set up.

### Ai (7:1-8:29) 

#### Ai defeats Israel (7:1-26): 

The Israelites\' second military encounter in Canaan is with the people
of Ai.

##### The sin (7:1): 

Achan disobeys God\'s command and takes some of the spoils from Jericho
for himself.

##### The setback (7:2-5): 

Israel is totally routed in their attempt to capture Ai.

##### The supplication (7:6-9): 

In great anguish Joshua complains to the Lord concerning Israel\'s
defeat.

##### The solution (7:10-15): 

The Lord responds to Joshua by telling him two things regarding their
defeat.

###### The cause (7:10-12): 

Someone in the camp has both stolen and lied.

###### The cure (7:13-15): 

The Lord tells Joshua to find the sinner and destroy him.

##### The search (7:16-23): 

The Lord gives Joshua specific instructions for determining who the
guilty person is.

###### The method (7:16-17): 

The Lord points out the tribe to which the guilty person belongs; then
he points out the clan, then the family, and finally the person himself.

###### The man (7:18-23): 

Achan is found to be the guilty person.

##### The stoning (7:24-26): 

Achan and his guilty family members are stoned and their bodies burned.

#### Israel defeats Ai (8:1-29). 

##### The encouragement (8:1-2): 

The Lord now gives Joshua a new plan to defeat Ai. He instructs him to
set an ambush behind the city.

##### The execution (8:3-29): 

Joshua carries out the Lord\'s instructions and captures Ai.

###### He sets an ambush (8:3-9, 12) 

###### He stages an attack (8:10-11, 13-14) 

###### He pretends to retreat (8:15-17) 

###### He signals to the men in ambush (8:18-20) 

###### He captures the city (8:21-29) 

THE TWO MOUNTAINS (8:30-35): 
----------------------------

After Joshua conquers Jericho and Ai, he carries out Moses\' parting
instructions.

### The altar (8:30-32): 

Joshua builds an altar on Mount Ebal and copies the law of God onto the
stones.

### The announcement (8:33-35): 

At the foot of Mount Ebal half of the Israelites read the blessings for
keeping the law, and at the foot of Mount Gerizim the other half read
the curses for disobeying the law. Then Joshua reads the entire Book of
the Law to the people.

JOSHUA 9-12
===========

Israel is deceived by the Gibeonites. Israel defeats five Amorite kings
after the Lord miraculously extends the day of the battle. Then they
defeat the rest of the southern cities and move north to defeat the
cities there, securing both regions.

THE SOUTHERN CAMPAIGN (9:1-10:43) 
---------------------------------

### The deception (9:1-27): 

Israel is deceived into making a treaty with the Gibeonites.

#### The characters (9:1-13): 

While the Israelites camp at Gilgal, some nearby Gibeonite ambassadors
arrive, wearing worn-out clothes and claiming they are from a distant
land.

#### The cause (9:14-15): 

Because the Israelites do not consult the Lord and do not realize that
these people live nearby, they are tricked into signing a peace treaty
with the Gibeonites.

#### The consequences (9:16-27): 

Upon learning the truth, Israel is forced to employ the Gibeonites as
woodchoppers and water carriers instead of driving them out as God
commanded.

### The destruction (10:1-39): 

God empowers Israel to fight seven successful battles and gain control
over all of southern Canaan.

#### The battle against the enemies of Gibeon (10:1-14)

Adoni-zedek, king of Jerusalem, and four other kings determine to attack
the Gibeonites for signing a peace treaty with Israel.

##### The plea (10:6-7): 

The Gibeonites appeal to Joshua for military help.

##### The promise (10:8): 

The Lord reassures Joshua of victory.

##### The provision (10:9-14): 

The Lord gives the Israelites victory by sending a hailstorm upon their
enemies. He also miraculously lengthens the day to ensure total victory.

#### The battle against Makkedah (10:15-28) 

#### The battle against Libnah (10:29-30)

Canaan to fight the Israelites.

his enemies will be dead.

Joshua completely defeats all these kings.

the Jordan is divided among the remaining 9½ tribes.

THE PROMISE (13:1-7): 
---------------------

The Lord promises to drive out the people that still remain in Canaan.
He tells Joshua to divide up the land among the tribes.

This tribe possesses the land east of the Jordan and just north of
Reuben.

### East Manasseh (13:29-31): 

This half-tribe possesses the land east of the Jordan and just north of

No land is given to them, for the Lord himself is their inheritance.

THE PARTITIONING (14:1-17:18): 
------------------------------

Joshua divides the land west of the Jordan among the remaining 9 ½
tribes.

Land areas for the tribes are determined by casting lots, supervised by

#### Caleb\'s reminder (14:6-11)

near them and occupy their land.

JOSHUA 18-19
============

seven tribes still have not taken possession of their allotted land. So
he sends scouts to map out the land for them.

THE DELAY (18:1-3): 
-------------------

After the Israelites set up the Tabernacle at Shiloh, Joshua asks why
seven of Israel\'s tribes seemed reluctant to occupy the land.

THE DISPATCH (18:4-10):

JOSHUA 20-22
============

cities. Joshua issues a call to faith to the eastern tribes. The
conflict over the altar that the eastern tribes erected is resolved.

THE DESIGNATED CITIES (20:1-21:45) 
----------------------------------

### The six cities of refuge (20:1-9) 

#### Why they exist (20:1-6): 

To protect anyone who unintentionally kills another person.

THE DIVISIVE ALTAR (22:1-34):

sends the 2½ eastern tribes back to their land with a challenge.

### The contents of Joshua\'s challenge (22:1-8) 

#### His commendation (22:1-3): 

Joshua praises the 2½ tribes for their obedience to God in helping their
fellow Israelites on the west side of the Jordan.

#### His caution (22:4-8):

to the east side of the Jordan.

### The confusion following Joshua\'s challenge (22:9-34) 

#### The altar by the 2½ tribes (22:9-10): 

The eastern tribes erect a large altar just before crossing the Jordan
River.

#### The accusation by the 9½ tribes (22:11-20) 

##### Mobilizing against their brothers (22:11-12): 

The 9½ tribes wrongly conclude that the altar is a pagan shrine; they
muster an army at Shiloh and prepare for war against the eastern tribes!

##### Meeting with their brothers (22:13-20): 

Before any fighting begins, a delegation led by Phinehas, the son of the
high priest, meets with the 2½ tribes. They demand to know the reason
for the eastern tribes\' pagan act and warn them of God\'s swift and
terrible punishment.

#### The answer by the 2½ tribes (22:21-29): 

The eastern tribes explain to Phinehas that the altar is to serve as a
memorial, reminding them and their descendants of the common faith and
kinship they share with the other tribes.

#### The acceptance by the 9½ tribes (22:30-34): 

The explanation of the altar\'s purpose satisfies the 9½ tribes, thus
avoiding a civil war.
