JOHN 3
======

Jesus meets with Nicodemus and tells him in order to be saved, all
people must be born again. John the Baptist tells his disciples that
Jesus is the Messiah.

JESUS EXPLAINS THE PLAN OF SALVATION (3:1-21): 
----------------------------------------------

A man named Nicodemus visits Jesus by night.

### The credentials of Nicodemus (3:1): 

He is both a member of the Jewish Sanhedrin and a Pharisee.

### The confession of Nicodemus (3:2): 

He acknowledges that Jesus is from God because of his miracles.

### The command to Nicodemus (3:3): 

Jesus says he needs the new birth.

### The confusion of Nicodemus (3:4): 

He confuses spiritual birth with physical birth.

### The chastening of Nicodemus (3:9-13): 

Jesus chides him for not knowing these things even though he is a
respected Jewish teacher.

### The clarification for Nicodemus (3:5-8, 14-15): 

Jesus employs three illustrations to explain the new birth to Nicodemus.

#### A physical illustration (3:5-7): 

Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the
Kingdom of God.

#### A natural illustration (3:8): 

Just as you don\'t know where the wind comes from or where it is going,
so it is impossible to explain being born of the Spirit.

#### A scriptural illustration (3:14-15): 

As Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man
be lifted up.

### The conclusion for Nicodemus (3:16-21): 

Jesus now summarizes both the subjects of salvation and condemnation!

#### The persons (3:16) 

##### The Father gave his Son (3:16a). 

##### The Son will give his life (3:16b). 

#### The purpose (3:17) 

##### It is not to condemn sinners (3:17a). 

##### It is to convert sinners (3:17b).

---------------------------------------------

### The argument (3:22-26): 

A debate occurs among John\'s disciples concerning which baptism is
valid-those performed by John or Jesus.

### The affirmation (3:27-36): 

John once again gives testimony concerning the greatness of Jesus.

#### Jesus is the bridegroom, while John is but a friend of the bridegroom (3:27-29). 

#### Jesus must become greater and greater, while John must become less and less (3:30-36). 

JOHN 4
======

Jesus meets a Samaritan woman at a well and offers her living water.
Many Samaritans in the woman\'s village believe in him. He heals the son

###### Liquid water (4:11-14) 

####### His revelation (4:13-14): 

Liquid water must be drunk often, but living water becomes an eternal
perpetual spring from within!

####### Her response (4:11-12): 

First, how can he draw such water without a rope or bucket, and second,
is he greater than the patriarch Jacob?

###### Living water (4:10, 15) 

####### His revelation (4:10): 

He will give her living water if she but asks.

####### Her reaction (4:15): 

She desires this kind of water!

##### Jesus contrasts real worship with ritual worship (4:16-27). 

###### The command (4:16): 

\"Go and get your husband.\"

###### The concealment (4:17a): 

\"I don\'t have a husband.\"

###### The correction (4:17b-18): 

Jesus says he knows she has had five husbands and is now living with a
man to whom she is not married.

###### The cleverness (4:19): 

Attempting to change the subject, she says, \"You must be a prophet.\"

###### The confusion (4:20): 

She asks, \"Why is it that you Jews insist that Jerusalem is the only
place of worship, while we Samaritans claim it is here at Mount
Gerizim?\"

###### The clarification (4:21-24): 

Jesus says that true worship involves not the where but rather the how;
that is, God must be worshiped in spirit and truth!

###### The conversion (4:25-26): 

She acknowledges Jesus as the Messiah!

###### The concern (4:27): 

The disciples arrive just as she departs and are amazed that he was
talking to an immoral woman!

#### The faithfulness of the Samaritan woman (4:28-38) 

##### As seen by the message she proclaims (4:28-30): 

She returns to Sychar and witnesses to the entire city!

##### As seen by the model she presents (4:31-38): 

Jesus uses her as a role model to his disciples on the subject of soul
winning.

###### He talks about the real food (4:31-34): 

When urged to eat some food they have brought him, he says his food is
to do God\'s will!

###### He talks about the ripe fields (4:35-38): 

He says that the fields of human souls are ripe for harvest!

#### The fruitfulness of the Samaritan woman (4:39-42): 

At her urging, many townspeople agree to hear the Saviour and believe in
him!

mat!\"

walk.\"\'

### The crippled man and the Christ-their final meeting (5:14-15): 

Jesus warns him not to keep on sinning, lest something worse happen to
him!

THE MESSAGE BESIDE THE POOL OF BETHESDA (5:16-47) 
-------------------------------------------------

### The tirade against Jesus (5:16-18): 

The godless Pharisees condemn Jesus on two counts.

#### He heals on the Sabbath (5:16).

#### From the Father (5:30, 37-38): 

The Father has testified about him.

#### From the Scriptures (5:39-47): 

The Scriptures point to him, but though the people say they believe the
Scriptures, they don\'t believe in him.

JOHN 6
======

Jesus feeds the 5,000 and walks on water. He teaches that he is the
\"bread from heaven\" and that all who wish to have eternal life must
eat his flesh and drink his blood. Many of his followers, unable to
accept this difficult symbolism, desert him.

TWO MIRACLES (6:1-24)

##### That he cannot show them his Father (8:19a)

He begins by saying that he is the light of the world, then answers
their charges.

### His clarification (9:9b-12): 

He affirms that he is.

INTERROGATION! THE PHARISEES AND THE BLIND MAN (9:13-23): 
---------------------------------------------------------

These wicked religious leaders now investigate both the man and his
parents.

### The man (9:13-17) 

#### The day (9:13-14): Jesus healed him on the Sabbath. 

#### The demand (9:15) 

##### The Pharisees ask the man what happened (9:15a). 

##### The man tells them how Jesus healed him (9:15b). 

#### The division (9:16-17) 

##### Some Pharisees say, \"This man Jesus is not from God, for he is working on the Sabbath\" (9:16a). 

##### Others say, \"How could an ordinary sinner do such miraculous signs?\" (9:16b). 

##### The healed man says, \"I think he must be a prophet\" (9:17). 

### The parents (9:18-23) 

#### The Pharisees (9:18-19) 

##### \"Is this your son?\" (9:18-19a). 

##### \"Was he born blind?\" (9:19b). 

##### \"How can he see?\" (9:19c). 

#### The parents (9:20-23): 

They answer yes to the first two questions but decline to answer the
third for fear of the Jews!

CASTIGATION! THE PHARISEES AND THE BLIND MAN (9:24-34): 
-------------------------------------------------------

For the second time, the former blind man is summoned to appear before
these godless men.

### Jesus is denounced by the Pharisees (9:24, 26, 28-29). 

#### \"We know Jesus is a sinner\" (9:24). 

#### \"We don\'t know anything about him\" (9:26, 28-29). 

### Jesus is defended by the blind man (9:25, 27, 30-34). 

#### \"1 don\'t know whether he is a sinner. But I know this: I was blind, and now I can see!\" (9:25, 27). 

#### \"Never since the world began has anyone been able to open the eyes of someone born blind. If this man were not from God, he couldn\'t do it\" (9:30-33). 

### The former blind man is thrown out of the synagogue (9:34). 

SUMMATION! JESUS AND THE BLIND MAN (9:35-41): 
---------------------------------------------

The Savior says he has come into this world for two reasons.

### That the blind might see (9:39a): 

Spiritual sight will be given to all those who sincerely ask.

#### The witness by Jesus (9:35-37): 

He informs the former blind man he is indeed the Messiah!

#### The worship of Jesus (9:38): 

The man worships the Savior.

### That those who think they can see might be blinded (9:39b-41): 

Overhearing this, the Pharisees rightly conclude that Jesus is referring
to them!

JOHN 10
=======

Jesus compares his followers to sheep and says that he is the Good
Shepherd. He also says that he is the Son of God and that his Father and
he are one.

THE MESSAGE BY JESUS (10:1-21) 
------------------------------

### The metaphor (10:1-6): Jesus illustrates his mission on earth by describing two different ways to enter a sheepfold. 

#### The wrong way, climbing over a wall (10:1): 

This is the method of thieves and robbers.

#### The right way, entering through the gate (10:2-6): 

This is the method of a true shepherd.

### The meaning (10:7-18): He explains his illustration by giving the characteristics of three kinds of individuals. 

#### Characteristics of the Good Shepherd (10:7, 9, 10b-11, 14-18): 

Here he describes himself.

##### His relationship with the sheep (10:7, 9, 10b-11, 14-18) 

###### He is the entrance to their salvation (10:7). 

###### He allows them to go in and out, and find green pasture (10:9). 

###### He gives them life in all its fullness (10:10b). 

###### He lays down his own life for them (10:11). 

###### He knows his sheep and they know him (10:14). 

##### His relationship with the Father (10:15-18) 

###### He knows his Father, and the Father knows him (10:15-16). 

###### He is loved by His Father (10:17). 

###### He is given power by the Father to lay down his life and take it up again (10:18). 

#### Characteristics of thieves and robbers (10:8, 10a): 

Their purpose is to steal, kill, and destroy!

#### Characteristics of a hired hand (10:12-13) 

##### He forsakes the sheep in time of danger (10:12). 

##### He cares nothing for the sheep (10:13). 

### The mixed views (10:19-21): 

There is much confusion concerning Jesus after he speaks these words.

#### Some say he is insane (10:19, 20b). 

#### Some say he is demon-possessed (10:20a). 

#### Some question whether he would be able to heal if he were in fact demon-possessed (10:21). 

THE MALICE AGAINST JESUS (10:22-39): 
------------------------------------

The Jews now attempt to kill the Savior on two specific occasions
because of his claims to be the Son of God.

### First attempt (10:22-31) 

#### His words (10:25-30) 

##### He says they are not his sheep (10:25-26). 

##### He says his sheep listen to him (10:27). 

##### He says his sheep will never perish and are eternally secure (10:28-29). 

##### He says he and the Father are one (10:30). 

#### Their wickedness (10:22-24, 31): 

They ask Jesus if he is the Messiah. When he says he is, they become
angry and pick up stones to hurl at him.

### Second attempt (10:32-39) 

#### His words (10:32-38) 

##### He says they refuse to believe in the Scriptures (10:32-36). 

##### He says they should believe in his miracles (10:37-38). 

#### Their wickedness (10:39): 

Again they unsuccessfully attempt to seize him.

THE MEETING WITH JESUS (10:40-42): 
----------------------------------

Jesus now leaves Jerusalem for awhile.

### The place (10:40): 

He goes to where John once baptized.

### The people (10:41-42): 

Many meet with him there and are saved.

keep his friend from dying.

#### The preparation by Jesus (11:38-40) 

##### The Savior\'s request (11:38-39a): 

He tells some men to remove the stone covering the cave where Lazarus is
buried.

They are afraid this will bring the wrath of the Romans down upon them.

The high priest Caiaphas says: \"Why should the whole nation be

--------------------------------

He and his disciples leave Judea briefly and retire to a village called
Ephraim.

THE WATCH FOR JESUS (11:55-57): 
-------------------------------

Many people at the Passover feast wonder if Jesus will attend.

JOHN 12

before by Isaiah (Isa. 53:1; 6:10).

everlasting.

feet.\"

and witnessing.

#### All Christians will be hated because Christ was hated (15:18-19).

WITNESSING (15:26-27):

The disciples do not understand when Jesus says, \"In just a little
while I will be gone, and you won\'t see me anymore. Then, just a little
while after that, you will see me again\" (16:16).

### The clarification (16:19-22) 

#### His explanation (16:19) 

##### \"You won\'t see me anymore\" (16:19a): 

A reference to his death, which will bring about great grief.

##### \"You will see me again\" (16:19b):

To illustrate the way their sorrow will turn to joy, Jesus refers to a
woman giving birth.
